Sometimes when uploading an image it gave an error having to do it again but its okay
 While it is possible to make certain modifications to templates I might discover that I have little influence on the overall look and feel of our app Some customers have expressed dissatisfaction with customer service
 Could not write a database to save data The site promised no code functionality and it is a lie I needed to learn how to code to get functionality
 Despite its userfriendly interface can be limited in terms of customization options While the prebuilt templates and design elements are great for getting started quickly more experienced users may find themselves frustrated by the lack of flexibility in design and functionality Additionally some users have reported issues with app performance and stability
 The possibility to track actions inside the app and the possiblity for a backup this is common to most of the other platform so we have chosen because offers anyway the best options for the other things
 App tutorial videos should be explained clearer information about Apps usage Moreover the technical team should not ask for information like email id or Fb id with the password for any technical issue or change Paying for images is another frustrating aspect of this app
 Could find any disappointing points and I am pretty slappy with the web development and other applications build software
 I think the feature that are missing is advanced option where we can try understanding the underlying coding system to us that has no idea of coding Though there is no aspects of the product that is hard to use I think it could improve by a more versatile version like it can be opened on a smart TV to present the idea to audience
 since is an app with no code it has limited features and functionality provided by the platform them self THEY HAVE NOT MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT SERVER STORAGE SPACE BEING GIVEN IN GB OTHERS DECLARE 35 GB OR 50 GB BASED ON PLANS U SELECT BUT THIS IS A GRAY AREASTILL MAY COST HIGH AS WE GET MORE FOOTFALLS NO CLARITY STILL  YOUR OWN GUY HAS NOT IDEA ON THIS DURING CONVERSATION PLEASE HIGHLIGHT THIS ON THE PRICING PLAN DONT KEEP HIDDEN THINGS MAKE IT OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PEOPLE WILL WELCOME
 I wanted to build a more complex app and was limited in that regard My vision had a detailed chat feature as well as a dynamic interface I also needed more control of the apps backend so as to collect other user metrics and data but I could not Appie Pie provides the developer little control over the user interface and functionality and this makes it rather limited for someone wanting to do more For example if you would like an animation when a button is clicked or some background activity to happen automatically when a user does a specific action
 Continuity in how it appears across different platforms For example Samsung vs iPhones vs tablets can look very different And sometimes when using the app I have to press my selection twice the buttons selections could be more sensitive 
 Limited UX design toolsCharge on plan too much for just have Apple Store listedCharge for remove logo too expensive and no make senseDont have a security agreement document for using customerApple ID Google Login when using it for their jobs
 they have very limited and boring layouts their layouts are not customizable and their functions are very basic and few
 Many times a received misinformation from the chat people also they submitted once my app without asking me They show that I add the  as moderators in the google console and they were thinking that i want to publish it But didnt want it out yet They didnt ask me
 For me personally I did not like that there no option for unlimited hosting So I have to keep paying multiple times for each time the app bandwidth run out also there no previous notification by email that the app is running out of bandwidth I notice that I ran out of bandwidth because users send me message that their app was block 
 Need more up to date design templatesSometimes the apps run a little sluggish because of the VM It would be ideal if the platform produces fast flutter like code
 While utilizing the stage there have been a few issues with the client care group where weve heard various tales about specific elementsAs I said in the master area one limitation is the plan highlights First time users will deffinetly confuse what they are making if you are looking for app making websites without coding I will give to this website  10 rating because i have tried other websites also for making apps The main play store is you can view how the app opportunity like but here you cant imagine how its look like because in other websites you just add blocks for your appand they clear mention about block how it will react Here there are no blocksbasically all app makers use coding so the blocks describe what it is
 A expensive to maintain subscription comparing to othersLittle known to the usersLimited third party integration Few things are there as everything is not perfect Lack of layout themes and design As per selected category few specific design are there and you have to use them  You are not able to add more design at your end Frequent update in platform might ended your app with resubmission as the too suggest to get it republished after every  months In India it might work to just display the name of the product on the product listing page like Butter Panner or Dal makhani but in Germany where the food is so diverse coming from so many regions people have no idea what the product contains just by looking at the name It also needs to display the description on the same page Otherwise its too much clicking navigation cannot work The system should have the possibility to allow this as its already like this on own website which is generated from the same app Showing pictures images on the product listing page is a major setback for categories with big product listing How does the end user need to find the correct product if there are more than 50 items in the list scrolling and scrolling and scrolling  Payment system eg Paypal amount could not be handled individually for the restaurants I see that technically it might be possible but the product management team does not want that4 The current review system inside the app is a major joke None of the customers who order food are able to provide a review and none of the customers who need to check read the reviews are able to do so  User management is of no use6 Translation of the app is possible but the backend system cannot be translated and the restaurant owners see all in english7 No reward or loyalty management system8 App size of 200 MB on iPhone9 1000s of bugs in the system
 Maybe update some of the instructional videos to make them a little easier to follow for some of us who have no clue whatsoever We have had the app we have made called Pitt Hopkins app since 2016 with  and we like most people recognise that there are some things that could be improved but to be far they have got better has time has gone by I would like to see multiple contact emails under contact button but saying that you could use directory button or editor button so its so minor Limited Customization application development platform may not offer users the same level of customization as coding and developing applications from scratch This could limit user experience and prevent their app from standing out in a crowded market Potentially Lengthy Development Timeframe Developing an app with can take up to several weeks depending on the complexity of the project which is much longer than if users coded it themselves or hired a professional developer team for faster result Expensive Monthly Fees for Professional Plans To access certain features such as ecommerce integrations and unlimited push notifications businesses might have to pay expensive monthly fees that are associated with more advanced versions of the software like Pro $49 mo or Gold $99 mo Unattractive Templates As most templates offered by are quite genericlooking they may not be able to attract any potential customers seeking unique designs over typical apps found elsewhere in stores such as Google Play Store & Apple iTunes Store
 The main thing I would say comes to the code customization part I have a had a hard time trying to implement a custom search feature and was told it was not possible when I have a deep feeling it is I am still keeping hope that we can find a way to circumvent the issue
 Unfortunately Their are some more factors which make the platform stressful and tough for developers or Noncoders First their is no much difference in App created on the Platform they all tend to look similarSecondly building a Clone App seems to be easy from start but definately going to be complicated Thirdly you have to be ready to spend if not you would have to stop your Project Half Way which seems the Platform is a little bit contradicting it own usability by anyone Poor They didnt help me when they answered in the phoneIt doesnt seem like anyone speaks English as a 1st language and both I and my computer engineer had a very difficult time understanding what they were sayingIn fact one tech support person told me to delete some of my work and repeatedly told me to do so then when I wanted to add my categories back because they should have never been deleted in the 1st place the add button didnt work to add them back againI tried different browsers and sent them print screens so Im wondering if this software works reliablyTheyre telling me to email them the problem when Im already sharing print screens and I have video through their live chatThere is an ENORMOUS language barrier and the features and functions of are not well describedI spent all day trying to learn what was a category and what was a listing and how to add a page in a category or maybe its a listingThere is no glossary with pictures and there is no i button next anything and their broken English makes it virtually impossible for communicationsI am perturbed that they told me to have them build my site instead after they told me to delete some of my work and their buttons no longer work to add what I deletedThat seemed kind of wrong and I wonder if anyone else was told to delete their progress and then their dashboards buttons were deactivated so they couldnt move forward again
 My least favorite experience is getting notifications from either Apple or Google Development with lingo that I dont understand I wish could be added it linking SpotifyWhen we added a podcast to our programming we used SoundCloud because it could be linked to the appI kinda wonder if more connections would have been possible with Spotify instead Expensive compared to multiple other competitors2Missing essential features such as You cant edit the format of your text content since basic tools are missing Font size font type bold italic justification etc Design customization lets you only change the colors and direction of the elements but nothing else You cant add a folder within another folder It has no hosting capabilities youll have to upload the content you wish to share through the mobile app through a thirdparty4Their support team is somehow divided the support@com personnel will redirect you back to the website chat support guys and vice versa
 Some features may be challenging to use for those with limited technical knowledgeIntegration with some thirdparty tools may require more technical expertiseThe app design templates could be more varied to allow for more customization options
 Non ho riscontrato molti inconvenienti con Appy Pie tuttavia ho notato che la qualità del codice generato può essere migliorata per garantire unesperienza utente più fluida Inoltre alcune funzionalità avanzate come la geolocalizzazione potrebbero essere integrate meglio
 The thing that I liked least about this software is the quantity of designs I wish they had more options for customization I dont like how my notification center looks It looks a little bit too computery and hard on the eyes I also wish the wording in some of my features were bigger But these are not major thingsat least I dont think so haha
 with a lot of data the app can be slow or connecting to external DB might require more than just drag and drop
 More training for the tech agents who handle the chats Often they just repeat from a script but dont actually answer the question And it sometimes takes a long time to get an answer Sometimes the techs leave you waiting without checking in to let you know they are still researching the question
 There is an issue with software security & source code You cant edit the software vastly & they will charge extra for IAP You can edit your software vastly or cant integrate advanced functions Closeable banner ads which minimize the advertisement for more than 40% i prefer that my banner ads have a block in all pages and visitor can not close the app Visitor has to close the banner to get the start quiz button and if its block it will not Add a section in platform which members who sign up in app and pay for it will not see more ads in the app
 They have to keep up with Google Play and Apple which can require a lot of rebuilds Definitely worth the price to get the Premium There are no such cons at this price range which also offers a free tier with limited capabilities But if we compare to some backend low code generator platforms like Back4App there should be some practical capabilities in the free tier too except that everything is at par with the expectations It is good for a small business that does not thrive on IT capacity Also backend integrations with onprem resources could be involved on a trial basis so that a POC can be designed
 If you are looking for super budget app building this is not your solutionIt is a little pricey if you are just starting up but the features and quality of the builds that you are getting is more than worth the money In the beginning there was a steep learning curve just because of things like changing the colors on one page would change the 15 other pages its just little things like that that are always seem to be improving on the office come along way is over the last year customer support his gotten a lot better but but yeah still definitely a learning curve associated with the app
 Some of the advanced features may not be available in the lower pricing tiers As a result you may need to upgrade to access certain functionalities In additional the softwares interface can be a bit cluttered making it challenging to navigate at times
 I enjoy the quality of templates offers but dont really appreciate the quality of stock images available I think should improve its stock quality for those whove been used to working with HQ stock from Istock and the restThere should be an inapp integration of a sort that waythe user will easily search or import better stock images or videos from a better provider
 third party software a la cart pricing 
 They could possibly explain other costs involved such as Google Location Services in advance
 All of sudden they increases cost of their planAny way if they clear it earlier it will ok for service they providing And one more thing that I missing so many time when Ineed to make hyperlink to the image or certain text even I searched on help there no answer about Hyperlink 
 Please help to add On FPX payment Gateway into all features that available FPXpayment gateway is very high demand especially in malaysiahopefully can please add on itThank you
 The downside of the platform is that some advanced features are only available in the highest subscription plans which can be costly for users who need those features Additionally while the platform offers a range of prebuilt design templates these templates may seem limiting for users who are looking to create more customized applications
 The high caliber of the apps that creates is another benefit The platform makes use of cuttingedge technologies to guarantee the dependability and performance of the apps built on it The platform also provides a selection of testing tools to assist users in making sure their apps are functioning properly before launching them
 The price And that it always need internet connection Would be great if you use most features offlineI need access to download the apk file but it is not possible anymore 
 Cons of this app where I can pretty much say theres very little glitches in the app not very anything issue no big bugs or anything but time to time it does glitch a little bit but it working very fine it does work good
 cost is a bit over some competitors however it has more features so there isnt really a comparative
 Push notifications could allow for more characters per postAlso new templates Although they do offer a free plan that allows you to create a limited edited html  site you really have to step up to one of there top two most expensive plans to really get any benefit out of itit isnt until this tier that your app will be placed into the ios store
 The only issue is for those who are more advanced in app development as this tool does not use all the personalization it would need as a traditional app home builder
 it is a nocode platform users may not have the same level of control over the performance and functionality of their app as they would with custom codingapps may face restrictions and limitations when it comes to getting approved and listed in app stores which can limit their reach and audience
 The only drawback it has that the Application size is somewhat higher than the similar app created with coding 
 Im incredulous about whether I will utilize again fundamentally on the grounds that I am morally against making understudies pay for a device that they will just utilize one time and probably never use again
 There are other ideas that I have and will share with the developers if requested outside of this platform
 I wish the social media side of the feature widgets were more enhanced to be more aligned with the look and feel of other social media platforms user profile likes shares etc its not really intuitive and thats basically my whole app building community so it would be nice to see this more enhanced 
 In the text fields the indenting and giving bullets to the text I could not find under setting of all features
 While there are many features on offer I found that there werent enough templates to get the UI that I really wanted More visual customization options would be a great added feature 
 the burg application sometimes when we enter certain data it displays invalid data without any time indicating the error
 I use our App to promote our ministry and stay connected with our partnersThe only thing I dont like is how Apple makes changes that impact our App but the great customer service provides solves the issues in record time that I can only use it 24 hours a day gave me a great opportunity to put my ideas into place
 He was very helpful and immediately understood what I wanted he was honest in telling me apple is very thorough and not so easy to get apps published on but he will assist me to the best of his ability I must say I normally struggle with the support team to understand English but this time it went smoothly I have encountered him and [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] that gives very good service
 Features are weirdly missing For example some video types on the video page use the native player while other types launch the website but only in the app Videos dont go full screen but only fill the app frame You can use the website page to launch external links but no other page is able to launch a link externally which is a huge miss Also page anchors dont work correctly and even though the editor page accepts javascript not all javascript works The code to jump to an anchor on pageload doesnt work consistently Its a great idea but the weird segregation across page features like deeplinking to other pages only working on some page types doesnt make sense 
 Somewhat buggy I tried to set up two different triggers and got some errors Upon troubleshooting with team realized it actually will work despite the UI returning an error message Indicative of a product thats a bit rough around the seams
 Even since Ive been using  Ive seen the level of customisation and design look and feel options improve and develop and look forward to this continuing to develop over time
 Technical customer service is polite and does their best but once in a while there is a definite language barrierMy recommendation is if you are having difficulty communicating with a Tech it is best to try again at a later time
 Price expensive speed of app is slow sometime app behave buggy support is good as get personal attention Live chat support sometime respond late
 At staring phase i found difficulties but finally customer support provided me step by step process to add features and listings with all configurations
 The company needs to focus in the marketingThere is scope for improvement with the documentation part 
 FONTSFONTSFONTS!!!! You can easily tell the persons who developed this App software is a software geek not a designer or a marketer FONTS are what communicate the image of a companies business as well as the feeling youre trying to send and this App software need drastic work in this area The other key element in building an App is the ability to place the right image on your app and this App number one does not allow a user to place a full image covering the app pageand cannot do the image adjustment sizing without seeking a skilled person to bring down the image sizing to accommodate this app software
 I had difficulty when i started to use it but now it is very comfortable to use since i adapted to its features
 Can be a bit hard to understand the submission process to Apple but this issue is easily averted by reaching out to the customer service team Took a few hours to get comfortable with the platform
 I took a good minute to think it over and I dont really have many negative remarks 
 the apps created with it are seen as junk by apple they will be deleted not approved at allthe abaility of this to create apps is so contained you cant make any good app any good with it that is not even a textbook type static app for your notes book and even then it wants to charge you unreasonably but even if all of this is okay the app will be rejected by appstore it was total waste for me  I created a simple free app for my notes
 With DIY there are few limitations like size of the APPSDK implementation although I guess they are working on it Some time you get automatically log out from the app The website is not like Wix where you can customize on you own way and like using HTMLTherefore it cannot be very fancyAlso for the payment gateway I cannot use other local ones hereUnless I pay 1000USD
 At times the uploading of videos or images during app set up can be unsuccessful and need to be redone
 The only thing I felt a little discomfort is when its reach to publishing part It kinda challenging for people who has no knowledge background on what what the requirement required by the google play mine has not been publish to app store yet
 The appmakers are not native English speakers so sometimes the preprogrammed text for the apps or the instructions in the appmaker are not written very clearly
 I did not like that my work could be viewed on their site where they show the apps that have been launched It is my intellectual property and I feel this is a problem 
 dealing with the Apple AppStore for publishing is not fun
 Setup and publishing the app is tricky There are a lot of steps to setting up the Google and IPhone app store access and codes BUT the team will get you through it if you are patient They are easy to get on the chat service and have always solved the issue in the end 
 doesnt have unlimited hosting plan compare to some app builder software in the market so payment is continuous for me every time my bandwidth is exhausted aside this I think is still my best choice for creating app for my customers
 There have been moments when I need something changed but there are fees for the app changes Since we purchased the premium plan I would have preferred no charges 
 Payment options are not there so that I can charge user to add and modify added listings Addresses are sometimes hard to be added Speed of app and performance vary as well
 Customer relations with  is their backbone I am using them for selling online coupons to help people getting benefited Location based directory is best as users of app can easily search coupon and ongoing offers nearby
 has limitations when it comes to designing more complicated apps such as those with dynamic interfaces or indepth chat features Similar to gathering user metrics and data control over the apps backend is lacking Little control over the user interface and functionality is given to the developer by Appie Pie
 First featureTabs It would have been better if there is a provision of sizing tab sizes It has feature that allows users to add their catalog which is highly on demand
 Needs more features for integrated interaction of worksheets and etc
 I like everything about this software it is easy to update change or edit
 I am happy with the functionality of this product More modern features I wish they would incorporate layouts with videos or GIFS we are in 2021 this should be a given
 the fact they removed the custom video feature
 On a basic of free trial version I appreciate the availability of features and types I didnt have any major critics over this software But I recommend a cost reduction for the proversion and also some additional free trials for students As it is also a learning platform for the app designers 
 Though not anything significant I have to rely on the developers at times for answering to some queries there is not  think I can say about them that is a bad thing And usually I can find one thing but is terrific and staff is amazing
 Outlook of the software Needs to be more attractive Some more options in design will solve the purpose 
 Make it bit smooth and faster so can we access if having low internet Offline function missing as internet is must to use the features Limited feature added Need time to time update
 the listing  i feel like it needs some new functions like cloning or something coz most of my work is in the listing and i have to redo all my work with every list which is boring sometimes but overall its ok 
 I wish the mobile app was more up to date to compliment building mobile apps on the go 
 This product is very expensive and it could be cheaper to accommodate smaller businesss like mine that dont make a lot of money but do need the App Very Poor and Pathetic Service I am Paid Customer since the last years but still facing lots of problemsSo now this is last year FriendsDO NOT BURN YOUR MONEY
 Cant charge a monthly fee to continue to use the software
 the change of options which I had free before and now I have t pay 
 It would be nice if Rumble Gab and Parler were included with the other big tech companies for easy integration of videos and content
 I would like to have more push service but that is all very good
 The integrations with third party if you need something very custom its a no no you have to geta very skilled team who can guess what they should do the documentation is laking some technical details
 databse Integration is Missing you cannot Integrate third party API limited layouts widget like pocket took must have more facilities to add on
 design opportunities it can be more creative to adopt website products in the different layout to make more user friendly
 Speed and cost I understand the challenges in distributing but as a customer I will always expect more for less
 Any app could always use additional featureshas been great about adding new features and improving its product
 We are working on making it a little easier for end users to save data securely so they do not have to reenter it each time
 Not great for a newbie for publishing I used other platforms that used excel files as directories that I found a little easier to work with I wish for more levels to build up my skills I am hoping for
 Troubleshooting bugs after app deployment can be a bit of a dragged out process 
 Poor tutorials and documentation created a world of frustration
 The fact that theres no custom video uploads option
 It would be great if I could put a folder within a folder page so I can structure appointments for different towns 
 Trop limité et certain thème ne passe pas sur tout sur mon application je choisis des Theme mais sa ne prends pas obligé de voir un autre thème et il yon a pas assez
 The free trial is incredibly limitedin fact my students and I had trouble figuring out some way for me to evaluate their work since the trial doesnt allow much in the way of beta testing or trial distribution It was also frequently the case that apps didnt work as expectedwhile sometimes this was because of student error in other cases it seemed as though there were unresolved issues with browser compatibility
 If I have to list something its the price However I really think after my product gets up and running it will more than pay for itself
 The need to resubmit to App stores when desiring to change features like the home screen splash page It would be great to be able to update those features without resubmitting similar to being able to change My Features 
 Whilst using the platform there have been several problems with the customer service team where weve heard different stories about particular features We were asking about very specific features though so if one only desires a broad use of the features then there should be no problem Canceling is terribleThe cancellation process makes the whole company feel like a scamTo delete your account which is a hard button to find in the first place first you have to delete every app youve builtBut to delete every app youve built you first have to go and remove your billing info for that appBut you cant delete your billing info without talking to a representativeAnd that representative is not going to be helpful and just let you delete your accountThey are going to try to convince you to stayAnd once they realize they cannot convince you to stay they will just ignore youI have been on chat with them for over 20 minutes I am still on chat with them nowTerribleAvoid Avoid Avoid
 Though is one of the best and easiest software to create mobile apps i feel the price is rather expensive especially when compared to similar products 
 I wish there was a button to switch the order of the posts and pictures withing the pages on the app that would make things easier The team should have been aware of the issues associated with the release of iPhone  in my opinionIt left my users as well as myself scratching their headsBut the issues were corrected quickly and to my satisfaction
 Would like a few added features Would also like when they do an update to let me know ahead of time so I can tell our app users
 Slowness price is comparative high Taxi feature is complex among rest I tried once but deleted later on as too many settings need to be fixedHosting and customization is paid What I say about dislike I dont think so there is anything say about dislike  is the best in the world  start for
 Support team does not explain the reason for the resubmit app
 Id like to add video options from my phone and directGPS 
 First time was somewhat difficult but after that the process was much easier
 The social network should be improved and every module withing the app maker should be highly optimized to get every customer 
 Wish you could duplicate icons with subcategories
 Not enough functionality Too many additional payments while using updating app
 I would like to see them rolling out new features on a more regular basis
 I would love to see more options for customization of features
 to get all of the features is relatively expensive
 UI options The limited options of display make itlook like a mould
 its a little pricey for me I would like to be able to use some marketing tools but cant afford them
 The  ad platform is not really effective If internet is slow app will not work need 4g or wifi network only few static pages work offline Ebooks once opened while having internet cab be read else not
 Few cons they have but as compared to the functionality we can ignore consand recommend to use this tool 
 Would like to see integration of databases like knack or stand alone SQL Integration with stand alone database platforms escpecially when using functions like qr codes or barcodes will be a huge benefit if they can integrate this
 Wow I dont imagine to least like anything about  its great software which give opportunities to noncoders to get something in Mobile apps market
 Price is high speed is a concern need rebuild to fix features something editing seems tough Over all average in terms of usage point of view
 sometimes the customer support can be very very very poor Also the payment systems are very bad for me who is in Zambia This is limiting to how much business I can bring to because my buyers have no option for a payment plan Integration with Facebook
 There were some delays in getting the app live I had to stay on the chat almost daily to get the team to resolve some of the issues but over all it was not a bad experience 
 Features provided are strong and further development of end user interactive components would elevate this product to the top picks The support is not good I have received support for hours and they do not give me a solution I ask something they leave me waiting and they close the chat I go back in and I have to explain againThe tutorials are not updated and they send you to the tutorials to review the tutorial which does not work or has changed the way of proceedingSome operators think that you handle the software the same way they do and they answer in an unpleasant wayI have been more than  hours in a support at the end the support was bad the next day another operator attended me and I solved the problem in 10 minutesAt the time of buying the license they are not clear with all the costs
 Good User interface and easy to use save time to build
 Tech Support is a little slow and the features need to be updated 
 I would really like to be able to implement a carousel into the app for scrolling left to right between features 
 the tutorial need to be more in depth to help any new self entrepreneur or start up companies to be able to do it all by him self 
 There are many features and it is a good product No recommendations for improvement come to mind
 I dont like that the features are sometime basic like fitness and donation feature 
 The experience of posting app online and maintenance of current online status ie preventing or quickly fixing things when Google Play or App store disable app is cumbersome It is up to the user even if paying $ to post software to check periodically that no updates to google play or app store terms impede the functioning of the app However most times once contacting appy pie they do fix it for you pretty quicklyBetter video integration = ie embedding videos into the app would be nice
 small errors but they can fix through the chatprices are a bit expensive
 When you first join you must realize this is a do it yourself app that already has the features build into the product that lets build your own app and design it So you will have to put work into it its not a thing where they do it for you unless you request it from them
 restricted in some areas but great app regardless
 Google and Apple keep changing their requirements and policies that results in a need fo resubmitting the app once a year in average The customer support team is there to help fortunately
 Had way too many problems They took away the availability to update to the Apple Store which was the main thing we needed it for 
 There are no cons I have found or experienced yet I wish more people knew about it 
 As for the things that I do not like this is that the advanced options or complex features I have to resort to natural programming since the tool is unable to meet those expectations I do not like the design of the applications that are already obtained that tend to be somewhat obsolete or old and finally I do not like the documentation of the tool since basically you have to learn to use it alone and stumbling
 The integration between messaging featuresand listing functionalitiesfeatures could be enhances for smoother integration
 Limited database access no source code youcannot sync api  sometime app on phone work slowly Limited moderator access
 Speed is a concern Limited space and bandwidth Remodeling is needed always with app as they use third party service which may hamper anytime They have no control over them
 App speed is concern space and layout design is missing if you are looking for additional They may charge you additional
 App speed hosting bandwidth is concern app needs constant update not like regular apps Less customization option are there
 The URL name isnt great but Ive found a solution Some of the guidance could be a little clearer but the support staff have always responded and provided the correct answer
 months to correct something small
 Every now and then I have trouble uploading to the play stores but the staff is always willing to help and my apps are submitted without a hitch
 Couldnt use the trial version to test the polling and survey option
 it is quite challenging with the google and apple developer programs  But  support is great and doing most of the work
 Enhancements that are not dated looking
 Having to pay extra fees through Google to utilize the map feature
 When I started doing the app development battled to get it to do what i wanted with inserting images getting to have a nice front end display the integration from page to page was not that user friendly
 is doing excellent but it will be more excellent if we can also able to make Android IOS games in it After an APP creation you have  month of free editing and after that  edit per month I understand that the creators got to earn some money but for me that dont have programming knowledges I need to see on the smartphone how my changes look like And If something doesnt come so good I need to wait another month It should be possible to connect only  phone on the free version to check out changes And then if everything ok publishing to other users
 there isnt much I dont like as I am not an experienced web developer I dont understand all the details but for what I need I love
 Maybe the Appy mark at times can be annoying when so see that logo But overall I have to admit that I love this app So I dont really much of a con right nowbecause this is great software
 It can take lot of time to integrate big features like AR  messenger and chat features but after some editing it easy to use They are sying 24x7 support but some time support not available only sales person available on chat
 video takes time to buffer and load player is old slowness is there but managable will surely recommend to others
 The gold plan could have the possibility to have the Apple ipa file and the price should be less expensive The duplicate feature should duplicate completely the old app any body can make like
 Not as much as confidential security features as it should be
 I was trailing the softwareTo be able to fully test it I upgraded and was to be on a monthly planI then found out that they had taken out the yearly amountI have then spend numerous emails trying to get a refund of the yearly amount less the first month fees I am happy to pay for the first month as I do appreciate developing these tools cost money
 As far as I have tested the application it is working great till now I have not faced any issues with the application 
 Kind of expensive for my small company I wish they were a bit cheaper especially during the current COVID economy
 It was a bit difficult to create picture galleries because every single language had to be created anew It would be easier if you could copy entire pages
 Customer Service was very bad except the last one we had with [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] otherwise customer service is very horrible
 It would be nice to see  Video conferencing being independentYouTube Videos dont show
 I havent found anything that I dont like about the software yet
 It limits you in some aspects on less you pay more In which case the app is awesome 
 The only feature i found hard to do is live video meetings but thats ok
 Some options are limited in terms of customization but overall the money spent on it justifies the limitations which I am sure in due time will be added
 The layout template functionality is very limited However I am still happy with the software
 An informed customer service agent would have informed me that the feature I wanted was not available when I inquired BEFOREHAND Training
 I like everything about the app so farThe updates and great and the customer service is fast and efficient no Cons
 Not much really i have had a few issues i contacted the costumer support and they fixed the issues pretty quickly Developed app should be more lighter i have noticed that apps are heavier and takes time to open Few more customization feature surely will make great for mobile app lagging features like use of affiliate account
  platform provides a lot of options but has limited options when it comes to layout More layout options are required 
 they made changes without updating us about the change in system  no information is given about the impact o change Form data is not availabel as api
 opening time of app is very high it must be reduced I think many modern technologies are available So  must invest to remove this fault
 Sad that IOS is no longer allow SDK to publish anymore This will mean loss of cusomters There is not a timeline to change the fact that we can not publish directly to IOS anymore espeicially since IOS is the TOP app develping software available
 Somebug issues that did not get resolved as fast as I would like when I made an app using this company Limited templates
 The software needs low coding therefore is there to use and also user friendly since it has good consultants and experts for help
 It sometimes hangs for mecant figure it out why Otherwise it is a good application
 Some of the settings are a bit limited therefore limiting what you can do Persons who can actually code and want to add a feature to make their product stand out might have a challenge in that area 
 The audio player is limited I would like more options for customization
 Todo me gusta del software me gustaría implementaran más funciones
 Gateway de pagamento deveria ser ajustado a necessidade do cliente
 super and funtastic experience  will alwasy reffer this with all
 It is only used once a year and each year I have to have support staff make sure the app is still on Google and Apple and they always try to up sale the package I have bought which is frustrating I feel that support should be included 
 Falta mais opções de interação com outras plataformas
 Id like to be able to customize things more
 Weird hoops to jump through to launch apps and sometimes theres a language barrier between me and support but again thats par for the course with similar services in this price range
 More documentation could be provided for beginners
 Cost is reasonable Specially lifetime platinum planI suggest that resubmission of the app should be part of the plan
 Schwierigkeiten bei der Registrierung bei Apple ich konnte nicht Registrieren da Apple zu krasse Regeln hat
 Would like more template options I like my template but would want more 
 What I like to list about this software is that it is a bit limited when it comes to the side of design in the user interface that user is limited to the options that are provided by the 
 The UX has clearly not been a priority Right on the landing page the CTA says Get started but as soon as you enter two pop ups appear one is a tooltip and the other is a message saying you cant do anything until you sign up Just use Sign up as the initial CTA or ask people to sign up when theyre done and want to save their work Less invasive and frustratingThe instructions for adding augmented reality are long riddled with links and are vaguely written A decent writer could probably fix that and save users from hours of utter confusion Templates could use some updating and possibly tone down the use of stock photos Less is more
 No negative concerns at this stage I have not found any issues that have not been resolved
 There are a couple of things Id like  to change one thing is the IAP feature I would like  to had a delete feature rather than a lock feature I think this would be more affective for past users
 could have more options to help customize the software apple submission is too hard with this app the should do submission for free that is the most i could say about the company
 It takes time to understand for beginners but after some time it very eases to use with frequent for them
 Some time response on live chat support is slowand some featuresare hard to integrate because third party API integration
 I wish there was just more features available for expanding the functionality of the apps created And that when using the push notification when a user clicks on the notification they could be taken to specific links Like the news section for instance when clicking on a notification for an article it takes you to the notifications system page and not the actual article that was created Or if you create a push notification you are limited in what you can link to internally
 Will be better if there are more design templates available Like goodbarber Only a handful are there Would love more design flexibility 
 For a novice it isnt very clear if the app is in test or live this could be made clearer on the screen
 Actually software charge us a huge fees to publish or download our software as a student these fees is not affordable for me  It need to decrease their product pricing 
 I would like to see additional app templates to choose
 The videos feature of the app when playing are fix to portrait screen mode It would be nice to play in a widescreen mode
 hard to navigate app store and google play
 I experienced a bug that didnt allow me to edit my app but customer support eventually took care of it
 Wish the features in beta testing would become full features a little faster 
 it is limited to features of your liking it should be opened for customers to build their apps using features of their liking whenever someone makes a payment for software your branding should not be on it your branding can be on the free package but once someone makes a payment the person must get a white page do not hide in other packages forcing the customer with no option than to pay it is a bad business strategy it leaves your customers with no choice than looking other places for something cool 
 The features could be more up to date and you should also add SSO for the app as well
 There are a few glitches that need attention but the performance of the software is good daily It needs more choices in icon shapes fonts and mp3 files
 Pricing is up and down but still customer support helps you to choose the right product 
 I know that our app is live in the necessary locations but my view on the initial page says it is not When I go through the steps to publish it I wish it would update that status on the bar at the top that shows on every page Identify to the new user the version of Android ComplianceEg some Android  devices cant find the App from PlaystoreStuff a layman wont know
 Changing in prices can fluctuate if you dont keep up with payments
 I feel sometimes the app is buggy but their customer support always up to fix those bugs
 Easy and to the point  this is the product that i wanted 
 Its still limited with some functionality You cant make a really polished app with it but it gets the job done for prototyping
 It can feel a little clunky to navigate but not bad I really enjoy it overall
 I dont find any issues while working on this software So far so good Few more customizations in app design will surely help
 Few features are outdated App is slow in comparison with other apps which I am using Cost and space problem Help tutorials are not easier in understanding
 Complex structureyou need to spend some time to operate it A bit slow app Speed and app opening time need to be checked and has to be fasten
 Varities on font size in different languages other than EnglishNeed more themesshould consider providing readytouse templates
 Need a few upgrades on the way you enter product info into store portion of the app
 Como es una aplicación de fácil acceso es poco creativa Se podría fortalecer creando una mejorada para tareas mas amplias
 needs to update their instruction movies on youtube 
 None problems resolved with IT support
 better versatility of app features with latest social networks
 When we want to make edits after publishing changes we have to reopen the editor which can make the iterative building process a bit more tedious at times Its not a big inconvenience but does get in the way here and there 
 The ability to only use WhatsApp for texting If it could be used as a generalized SMS app that would be perfect 
 Honestly not much except the editor page window thing
 vraiment facile dutilisation le service de chat daide et incroyable toujours disponible
 There have been no significant issues to date although it may be useful to have examples to follow at the start
 Some of the latest app features look amazing however need a little polishing to work properly
 The app designs are limited Would have loved to see some more design options
 There is only a limited amount of features to add to the app itself and there is only limited layouts available Could do with more options for each of the features and layouts Also sometime I needed to be transferred to some other customer service support person or had to email a different department Would be easier to deal with one person from the start 
 very best software for app making easy to use 
 Gift cards for restaurants Clients could buy a gift card directly from the restaurants and send it to the person they would like to receive the gift just putting their email just like amazon does
 FaultlessTheres no element of my experience to publish stage that needs attention
 There are lot of constraints on formatting The UI after finishing does not look good as some of the other apps do designed by Appy Pie Once you release your app it is a pain to update unless you have someone dedicated for maintaining the app
 I did not understand how to publish the app at first and what the process was but got it figured it our from a couple of tutorials
 Pricing bit high also limited and old tutorials which might confuse you sometime Publishing steps are tough
 We have needed some additional customizations which can be a little costly but customer service have been great to work with to get dialed in on our needs
 Sometimes crashes but very rarelyAs long as you close the app and restart it the app functions normally again 
 Speed can be improved Videos cannot be opened full screen For rotation of screen app rebuilt is needed Help page seems complex
 no direct video hosting
 I havent noticed any problem as of now 
 The limitation on home page design as a graphic designer I would like more customizable features
 Sometimes the app takes to long to load 
 Keep the radio internet station features coming
 Limited app designs during customisation
 SOME OF THE FEATURE NEED TO BE UP GRADED ESPECIALLY PAYMENT METHOD FOR COSTUMER IN THE MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY
 At this moment i didnt found any problem yet
 The con about this software is that it isnt any con
 As a noncoder takes a little use to understand the basics
 some of the intergration with business processes is a little difficult due to some of the limitations of the integration between features
 If you want to do anything more than just the basics youre going to need to get in touch with other third party  extensions? not sure what theyd be called honestly Also the backgrounds and templates just arent very attractive though you can edit them pretty easily 
 It is difficult in regards to finding out if this App is transferrable to the Google Play App Store Using the barcode scanning method may not be appeasing to many
 This software can be ever so slightly buggy unfortunately The free version doesnt let you modify the APP regularly Even if you post in Facebook will only have  edit per month
 It can be tricky to edit some of the pages 
 Believe it or not there is no cons Im impressed by professionalism and knowhow
 Complex structure of user group can be bit easier user permission coming after app installation is a headache sometime Push notifications in PWA appsare not at all worthy
 manually skin of the layout should be more varietiesSub layers must be upgraded and the login login icon can be customize if future
 Slower app costis higher and spaceproblem Customisation is zeroI am using and recommending this to other apart from having few loopholes
 I would like to see machine learning and AI be implemented along with it
 The software is modularized which is a pro and a conThe modules to extend your phone app are within a fixed library however this library is constantly updated to make new content   features availableAs long as you keep up with the new features and take a bit of time to investigate how they may make your app more robust the options then become limitless
 A large number of popups appear in your free apps almost every interaction can cause an ad to appear
 Tried to use the software on one of my tablets and I was have a hard time So I just use the software on my workstation Would have been nice If it would work on my tablet
 The integration with Flutter will be awesome and desired
 Limited to nonsupport deceiving no resolution to my existing request 
 App little expensive with add ons but not a dea breaker service makes up for it
 Some of the features are limited to specific use cases We ran into challenges with developing the type of app we needed but the customer service team helped answer our questions and help us find workarounds
 None I can think of only feel its very hard to get published on Apple
 I actually dont have negative credit for this app
 The app is slow to load and also I have the platinum plan the Branding is still showing 
 I am pleased with the software however I did have a few issues with getting up the store in my app Would like to have the ability to delete attributes
 HOWEVER THE DESIGN OF THE APP COULD BE BETTER ALSO THE AUDIO FUNCTION AND BACKDROP OF AN OLD RECORD PLAYER IS OUTDATED AND OR OLD 
 The price seems a bit high to me or at times they subject you to get other options to avoid their brand
 Their inability to make an app workable on the app store and google playThe app doesnt work at all and they lie all the time Their accent is horrible and they are unable 
 You cant custom code you have to pay them to do itOverly complex apps cannot be built here
 The UI is not that much intuitive and needs more learning to understand and work with advanced features
 Limited preset to choose from As in the themes available are not a great number
 very easy to accesi like so much and i am very satisfied with your servise so ill contine and prome to others thanks again team
 If you are not too familiar with creating online applications this product can be a bit tricky I recommend having a base knowledge before getting started 
 so far sogoodI am not having any problems with the appEverything is fine so far for meHope this is enough to help you
 Only thing which I feel is sometimes it is confusing on enterprise level which leads to talk to customer service 
 Email from support engineers responsive time can be reduced to a shorter period to increase our business productivity At times customer service officers have a bad attitude replying chat messages Some of the app features lack of user interface that users might have problems to understand the function 
 Limited space code not generated and subcription based model So I have to pay always to make my app running thats sad part
 Area of improvement could be providing more templates and designs for building a app Make it more customizable by adding more options to build an app
 There are many things that cannot be translated to the language you need like calendar days and some labels and alerts And even some texts that you can change appear in english anyway
 it can be buggy but if you let their development team know about them they are quick to remedy the issue 
 The only thing I did not like was once I was done and ready to push upload to Google Play & Apple I was then hit with another bill to take their branding off my appThey do show the upgrade in a box however if you do not click on it you do not see that as an optionOverall still a good annual price as long as there are no technical clichés
 What I did not like was the lack of flexibility with some of the options we could choose from for the most pat everything is good but if you want to add text to certain parts drag and drop things chose more layout options an customize more youre kind of out of luck until they can improve things Other than that you can get what you need done
 App speed on android devices On apple is great And also androids but androids can use a boost up 
 Loaded and for Newbies you needed time to understand the navigation
 the graphic design they offer is outdatedThis is the only frustration I have when they make it more modern it will be great
 Some times we get overhwlemed with many options
 Not enough flexibility in customizing each section 
 Spanish translations are not very accurate
 Usually the support staff is great but there have been instances where they werent super responsive which made the experience tedious at times 
 cannot customise a lot at all customer service can be crappie if you meet the wrong one mostly not good only one that is incredible
 all is wellThe best app Ive ever seen
 Feature is so Useful and common button need some extra and Exclusive feature
 the only problem is that it makes the app look similar to every over app and i did not find how to put in the app store
 I honestly can say that I cannot think of any cans when I am using this software I also thought the customer support is awesome
 When I was using the first time Getting much confusion But now it is working well First time always difficult
 In some cases the app wont work on specific devices then you need to contact the support in order to fix it
 The verbal communications in English between customer service employees and client sometime difficult to understand due to different mother languages
 I dont see anything which may trouble me in this software OVERALL ITS A NICE SOFTWARE to use and helpful
 Price bit high App needs rebuild as using many third party service providers Which is good too and sometimes bad as well
 So far no cons everything is perfect it works great and without any difficulties Keep it up guys
 For iPhone users if they want to use stabilized version we have to get Apple Developer Account and its very difficult process also costs some money Well honestly  havent come across an unpleasant experience till date These guys are pretty much consistent since day
 We havent experienced any such lack in services or difficulties yet Till date were smoothly working on it
 I think there should be an easier way to make a more beautiful app since I dont know much about graphic design and it could be overwhelming the amount of things I can tweak and customize
 My only con is the price and the fact that I dont own the app I have to pay to change anything It seems that i am paying for the app to be hosted I wish that there was a price that allowed me to own my app outright once its complete With unlimited changes
 So far I am happy with the software however I would like improvements on how items appears in their stores
 A few unexpected addons that would be expected in the packages you buybut they work with you on these so you are not left in a glitch Comunicating your needs is important with themthey will hepl you reach your goal 
 need for graphic updates I would like to change the appearance of the app but didnt find any way to do this
 The cost to resubmit the app for review is a con of this program despite being a gold life time member
 A suggestion might be to have an API that allows me to pull from user database on
 Well there could in time introduce more themes and creative aspects to the listMore payment teams need to be able to be integrated with this software than we would have a much better product
 Not really everthing only something but overall good
 I feel as though it could be a little more comprehensive and with a little more done on the customer service aspect 
 Sometimes the english translation could be better
 The icons on the home screen are hard to keep in place I would have to set and reset them constantly and some of them still wouldnt show up properlyAlso submitting the app to go live is a little weird but thats just due to my inexperience [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] from support helped make it go smoothly
 The social media Facebook like feature the pictures are not great when uploaded one has to click on the picture to see it clearly
 i feel there is more to be done on design part for applications  look and feel is missing  although you can not complaint at the cost being charged
 The app doesnt require codingAs a result there are templates so it can somewhat limit the layoutIts the tradeoff for not having to code
 Some feature could be more integrated But globally its amazing
 There should have better coordination and linkage between the modules eg to have the link from articles to news and directories and vice versa it is hard in the changing of the fonts and alignment of text inside the text boxThe forms cannot be used easily across all modulesThe generated website is not attractive
 Maybe could have more fancy templates as an option to select 
 No Nearly all features are available It is also very easy to use Any one having a little knowledge of computer can easily use it
 None of itall i have to do is open the chat and thats it
 Can be daunting learning curveYoure stuck if you want a design that is not available in the existing templates
 Sometimes Google Play Store block the app because we can change the apps internal codes remotely Price is bit high comparing to other services but there are more features available Need more tutorials Cannot change the target api level and those related basics Limited customisation options but thats probably ok for most people needing this service Mostly terrible service I had to talk to  or  people before I got any answers My emails were ignored and i was left hanging on an online chat I eventually got customer rep who was fantastic and fixed it all up for me in a flash but it shouldnt have got that far
 The PWA option does not work on the Android platformIts an easy fix to publish it to the Google Play Store but having it available as a PWA for both Android and Apple devices would be ideal
 Maybe the cost that is a little high it could be a lower cost after having several applications but in general it is very good
 If I could ask them to update their designs to make it a bit more modern but for what I am using this app for it still works being basic
 I really do not have any complaints Im really happy with the results of the work waiting to return to work with them again Great service
 So far I dont see any cons with Appy Pie Everything works wonderfully 
 The app created here when installed in phones will ask for many permissions including changing system setting 
 Trying to find some but not really able tooThe only thing is we needed to be patient and allow them to offer the google classroom featureWe understand how the process can be with google and just needed to be patient
 From the time i downloaded this app till today so far when ever i encounter any problem i will seek help from the customer support which they will take less then a min to reply So i dont really have any complains about this software
 Video player need to be changedFull screen videos not possibleand speed is slowPrice is highKeep updating ityour tool as brush up required alwayswith featuresyou have 
 i think that it would be great to upgrade the software to have more options in choosingtemplates and themes it also be great if you add more items and more pages that defiantly will make app creation much more easy and powerful
 sometimes it was hard to figure out how to get certain things to happen on the app I know what I wanted to add but looking through the add ons to find the right one took some time at first Now I know what to look for 
 The process to build this took much longer than I thought was necessary I was unaware about having to make an apple developer account until I was at the end of the process so I wish I would have done this sooner That would have the sped up the process by at least a month
 Limited scalability may not be able to handle large amounts of data or a high volume of users which can limit its usefulness for businesses or organizations with high growth potential or a large user base
 It is a zeal that this software should at least set up a demo version for practice to user who have never used it
 Website builder is good but mobile app builder is way too behind In fact the market of DIY mobile app builders did not attract a lot of audience considering some technical complexities involved Good for building basic apps but not functional integrated apps
 so far everything all features and you can custom they way you want and pick you own color
 What I like least is just the integration of outside objects I would love to be able to incorporate a native powerpoint or word document for example 
 The only thing I hate is when Im on  website I get bombarded with offers to upgrade my app I keep telling them no but they insist on trying to sell me something so I exit out of the website sometimesI almost deleted my account because of it 
 Would like to see a QR code scan to email feature but I figured out a workaround
 Occasional glitch other that we loved it
 All i could say is that there app build are awesome somehow the apps released are bigger in size and sometimes laggy
 I wish the tutorials were more up to date with the current changes of the developer websites for google and facebook
 You have some restrictions in templates and you can customized it to much also the way to customize each section is kind of manually that would be great to have a general customization to optimize times
 customer service is horrible takes forever to reach someone if you have another option TAKE IT Its somewhat tricky to get your app on different stores such as apple and google play if you have two factor security turned on and they fight tooth and nail with you over everything
 MORE MODERN THMES ARE NEEDEDSO YOULOOK MORE UPDATED TO WHAT EVERYONE LIKE THESE DAYS ICONS TOO TO COVER OTHER LINES
 Havent found anything negative yet When we have any issues their customer service team is able to help so no cons at the moment
 The loyalty card feature just looks terrible and it is REALLY hard to get the information on there in an easy to see wayWere going to use the feature because we need it but will you let us know when you update it so we can make it look a lot better?
 My tumblr would not link up to the blog app I tried multiple ways and looked over their tutorials but nothing seemed to work I then was told by Customer support representativeto attach the url to the website app and it worked 
 With any app building platform you can find some
 It could be better it is pretty basic right now but hopefully over time it will have more templates and more features
 In the apk the app builder generates requires permission from the users phone for functions that I didnt include in my app location camera contacts etc I wish I could deactivate these permissions that I dont need while building my app 
 Software is easy to use and simple to setup
 Design of UI is slightly outdated If they upgrade their UI and layout it would be fantastic
 As of right now just the ability to easily cancel or edit payment method and subscription levels maybe
 Tech support is based in India and it seems like there are some form responses given that do not exactly relate to your previous remarks on the chat They may also try to sell you stuff during tech support
 Per ora nulla sono un paio di mesi che lo uso
  templates looks ancient and old if youre looking to develop a modern day world class app then look somewhere else because  doesnt have a lot of modern features
 The app itself can be a bit clunky but overall a great solution
 I would love to see more features added However all the features they have you can create an app for about any use that a company would need
 Need to help out a little bit in more of the steps That is after you design your app what are the next ACTUAL steps to get your app in the Google playstore
 It can be a bit buggy around formatting and use of images so a lot of trial and error is involved in getting the look just right
 I did not understand the process of publishing at the start figured it out lately and the fess for publishing to third party marketplaces
 When I used it Apple Store rejected it because its a template solutionThe look and feel werent that modern and it could still be improvedIt appears that if I use their template itll look like everyone elses who use 
 More design themes should be added Customization options should be there at the app level which is restricted now
 A user should have more field space available in certain areas for names of buttons headers etc
 Im still using it as trial no bad yet Ill recommend to create support live chat
 La piattaforma è di facile utilizzo ma forse andrebbero rivisti i metodi di esportazione dellapplicazione per a pubblicazione sui diversi store 
 The least thing I like about is at first I was confused on how to use it I was lost and frustrated
 some the layouts are pretty pragmatic Type breakout and selection is hard to see what you are doing There should be an auto save function
 Cant really fault the software its suited our company needs
 Youre stuck in a little bit of a box not a configurable as I would like
 The only reason I didnt give customer support five stars is on multiple occasions I have had to reach out to their team to address the same issue This is normally not the case and the support team usually takes care of it but it really depends on who you get connected with via the chat system Top upoption in drivers app Need this for cash paying client to get the commission2Local Payment gateway like Gcasheverybody here is using this3 The above challenges is holding us to roll out THis was already brought up  months ago
 It is a little buggy content doesnt always load and when working on the app it sometimes does not save your changes I make sure that I save my progress regularly
 I would like to see the photos bigger in my app
 We would like to have it integrated with ASI software Nothing major just a slight glitch in the software where the test app was not working but the team fixed it in less than 12 hours before my morning presentation
 It would be great for the save function to be more obviousAlso previous versionsAnd easier way to add screen shots and logos
 not easy to start but all whats new is never easy
 That it took so quick to build an app
 The paygate with is very unrealistic for the market The free version offers little to no substance making it difficult to convince users to actually invest time and money Its quite annoying how the pricing is set up The features of the 2nd tier plan comes nowhere close to the top tier when also compared to the lowest  plans offersI wish you were at least able to remove the Branding with the 2nd tier
 Very limited with customizations when customizing app
 Interface is limited to modify looks old design n layout Analytics do not provide complete data App speed a concern
 It doesnt have a special theme for wordpress site where some plugins will work with the App For example related post should be at the end of a post push notification should be directly from wordpress post I dont really like it as you call wordpress post using RSS feed not really good There is a plugin called BlappSta it converts wordpress site to App so easy but not available on OS it would have been a better option for me but their customer support is so poor compare to yours I dont like the condition that if I dont go for yearly plan you cannot submit to Apple store
 None at this point because of the pros While a lot of the features will not immediately be obvious with the knowledge base and chat support I do not see them as cons
 Getting renewal certificates for the push notifications were tough for meEventually the customer support just did it for me
 some would like to be able to customize some of the data we collected better 
 I thought that some aspects of it were not user friendly Its not free lol Well you also need to pay another $25 to Google Play Console in order to publish your apps there and Apple iStore charges $99 yearly so tight your budget
 The templates are fairly limited It would be nice if I could find an open template that I couldbuild in
 I wish I had a little more featuresSometimes I would like to upgrade my users experience but it is hard to do that with little featureIf my app get bigger I will have to hire a professional 
 The interface is a little complicated at times while customizing within your app but it is pretty good for a nocode app developer Besides I can ask the live chat any time I have issues and get help immediately 
 I wish there was a little bit more graphics but it worked great 
 The fact that when you get late to pay it is locked and you cant use
 The inability to layer in widgets into othersFor example I would like to leverage other widgets within the edit widget
 That some the information is outdated They need to update some of their information
 It really isnt the part that I dont like its actually when it comes to submitting to iOS App Store It becomes very difficult
 Ads are my biggest issue but that is on Googles endLuckily there is appy jump now
 Customers not able to text via app with just a click of a button
 You can see on the app that it is a template based software
 The main creators of the software are base in usa getting through them via contact numbers or email takes alot of time for them to responseMain reason is because of the time difference and it cost alot contacting through their international number
 some bugs in the editor and the editor isnt flexible enough
 I do think there are features that are missing and could be improved and I also think the price for the value is a little exacerbated I dont think that you should have to pay for the middle plan to get the watermark removed It seems like the least expensive option is just a few minor features above the free one which is discouraging I think they could certainly add some features to make this midpackage a little more tempting Aside from whitelabeling also adding more email capabilities would be incredible I am thinking of a full funnel Involve can fulfill the lead capture and the first step of an email campaign but no further than that therefore its a lot of piecing things together to make it flow and Zapier doesnt integrate well with the platform So I think that having the full picture within one platform would make involve SO much better It is great but obviously everything can be better and make our funnels run seamlessly and smoothly I wish you could MOVE the slides pages from before the outcomes to after and transition to an outcome easily I accidentally put the pages on the wrong side and had to completely rebuild all the pages I also wish they had a more intuitive builder like something you could maybe map out a little better with both horizontal and vertical layouts The jump to and outcomes with logic get extremely confusing More explanation on these would be great Ultimately support has been very helpful
 The price and the baiting with limited features was the most frustrating You basically need to purchase the most expensive plans to have features that seem like they are necessary just for basic operation not able to prevent quiz loading for visitors upon page refresh or new pages annoys the heck out of them 
 Integrations could be a bit smoother I had to manually execute some of the tasks that were supposed to automated through an integration and also didnt like the every feature required an upgrade 
 Customisation takes a little longer and a lack of templates which are unique to your brand to help scale up production
 More templatesWhile they have a lot of templates having more varied quiz templates would make the creation process even easier
 Not actually a con but more like a necessary steps to be taken for further development The roadmap is just right & implemented accordingly For the Calculation Formula they need to speed up the development since it is one of the core aspect of the App
 If you let people use their own domains instead of involveme forced domains everything will be good
 Personally it would be brilliant to have some short tutorial videos on the logic of creating psychometric tests and calculators that said their templates are very easy to adapt and follow
 The biggest con here is that Involveme may be stepping away from their initial intended purposeLately theyve created some extra features which probably just were not needed like accepting payments in the forms But maybe thats just my use case There is a cost and benefit evaluation when using a service like Involveme While I love seeing my users engaged with the quizzes and surveys Ive created my site is a hobby and adding the costs of Involveme to my hobby is a crucial decision to make I think the price is rather steep starting at $25 mo and I wish there were a lower tier as my needs seem to fall in between the limitations of the free level and the starter plan With that said the 14day trial gives you a good idea of whether the service is helpful to you I think it is
 Overall really satisfied with Involveme I would love to see more options around conversational forms and interactive video Also im hoping they will continue to expand out their integrations
 Keine mir gefällt alles an dem Tool und ich nutze es täglich
 Not really anything to say negatively honestly The one thing the client did want to see was the specific answers someone gave that were then tallied within a module that would then reorder the rest of the survey going forward I dont know much but I do know that was quite a big ask And in the end the solution we worked on together linking to other survey modules and ordering them based on the clients knowledge worked just as well if not better 
 The tool is fairly new and needs a few improvements My top ask is for them to have Webhooks integrated That would open up so many more opportunities for interactions with other products such as CRM systems which would make it powerful to use Also at present the calculator feature is quite basic and buggy If I want to create sophisticated calculations like expected returns using a mathematical model I cannot use this tool in its current state The charting abilities of the tool are also quite basic at present However I do acknowledge that the tool is in its infancy and with a great team backing it BrandQuiz will only get better going forward
 We are not that much comfortable about the pricing plans their pricing could be more userfriendly both for long term and short term commitments
 Maybe the least like is that there are still some gray areas in the logic jumps of the platform Like if I were to make complex decision trees in a survey to come up to an outcome I was not able to do that right out of the box
 Lack of calendar  datepicker custom field so we can get bookings via our lead forms Is quite a shame Brandquiz left this very important feature out and this can be a tilting point to bring in more potential users for them
 I dont likeThe UI is very uggly but fast No amp supportProblem with analiticNo good stats
 The frontend speed performance seems slow Fast loading pages are really important today for user experience especially most of our traffic are mobile users
 Signed up for the trial only for them to bang up my card [SENSITIVE CONTENT] later They refused to refund my money and was forced to open a dispute with my credit card company I see I am not the only victim here as I see others with the same experience No point in arguing with them as they are out of Austria and they do not care about anyone but scamming money with this crap service
 I still thinking that native integrations are better over zapier the software has some but they can consider include more native integrations for autoresponders or CRM
 I havent really found any cons as such They recently added the ability to have dropdown options as well as a slider The team is constantly adding new features One feature I am looking forward to the most is the webhooks feature That would allow much more power in moving around the survey results directly into other apps
 The free version doesnt allow you to capture emails so I was forced to upgrade
 a different way of visualizing the pages in a project maybe mindmap like would make workflow much easier 
 If you embed you quiz on your site there is a small white boarder around the embed that you cant get rid of
 A couple of the features are still developing Im looking forward to more advanced calculator features but the roadmap has those things coming
 I would like a visual builder and the editor can be a bit buggy but support was very good when I did have an issue Here is my problem with this company I canceled my contract exactly 30 days to the day I first signed upBut because it was  hours and  minutes after my original contract date they dinged me for another full month You have got to be kidding me?Customer Service person would not budgeThis is not the type of company you want to do business with Think twice before committingLook around you can find better products from more reputable suppliers
 The functions could be more for examplefor custom outcomes depending on the quiz score Support says it will be coming
 Allowing the CNAME feature to hide the URL of the quiz is only available on the agency plan and not on the pro plan
 The tag in Activcampaign are not possible yet
 It is expensive especially considering when you want to remove their branding you have to get the toptier plan I feel that once you start paying regardless of which plan they should not try to promote themselves still by putting their branding on it Also it slowed down our website A LOT and with Googles core web vitals coming up we could not risk it The only thing missing which i truly feel will br an asset for brandquiz allow users to login via their social accounts for click convenience Good for us publishers
 No payment integration for customers available
 I would have liked more features and more flexibility in quizzes and surveys creation But they are a great team and you can talk with them as well as suggest new features
 Lack of flexibility in redirecting after the quiz is over
 not very mobile optimisedstill requires a designer would be good to have tips for a well optimised form
 I hope it can provide a native integration with my Email Service Providerthey need to speed up their development speed though The tool is halfbaked and broken The calculator has the most basic formatting errors including not having commas automatically placed when a visitor enters in a number forcing the visitor to have to count how many times they hit zero for example when entering the number 6500000 despite having a loan calculator as one of their prebuilt templates The color picker wheel to select text color change was also broken I mean cmon basic features of what their core tool set should be about
 It wasnt as simple to figure out certain features I had to do some digging for help articles
 I would have liked a more complex logic jumping Would also be great to be able to connect it to the shop products with a shopify app so that the outcome could link to a specific product in the shop Their prices are competitive but its still find it kind of expensive if youre only using one of their offered features For example I only use it for one quiz funnel and pay $25 month to get the integration features Slow development updates2 Zapier Integration is not robust Doesnt support more specific fields A few things are missing for a star re features support for custom domains would be the most crucial one
 Becomes difficult to use the more indepth you want to get like every service website you have to upgrade tk get full optionsI think if involveme give a trial period of  days of use is most helpful than giving just 100 submissions
 DO NOT use free trial If for nay reason you miss the cancelation say bye to your money 
 It didnt had a page to collect the leads email before giving the results 
 I wish there was an easier way to send the surveys to my residents I copy the link and send them that in their emails
 For a nonprofit organisation it might be a bit expensive to afford a yearlong plan
 I dont know yet perhaps you cant remove the branding on the free trial But thats understandable
 Price point is high for my monthly business 
 A little too many restrictions in the free version but it is a fantastic tool nevertheless
 The calculate element is not available in the free version
 a little on the pricy side if you only have one or two uses for an interactive form Sometimes I want a given quiz option to be associated with multiple possible quiz results however only  option is allowed to be associated with  outcome
 Some changes in the process are possible only at the cost of losing some historical data For example you cant move a field from phase A to phase B You have to recreate it as a new field and delete or hide the old one
 I think it would be helpful if they integrated more complex metrics like performance and activity duration for example the Gantt chart could show how much time has passed since an activity was scheduled We find bugs all the times We had a major migration to  that was cancelled due to  critical bugs They were fixed  months after we reported itIt misses basic features PDF builder sucks Reports are almost uselessSales team lies to sell
 It is very frustrating to know that a part of the emails sent through these platforms some services like Gmail or Outlook send these emails to the Spam folder I feel that I am doing the best practices so that this does not happen and thus have a good performance in the automations that I do with  but it doesnt always go as expected because the emails are marked as Spam meaning that the recipients never see the emails that I have sent through this platformMaking calculations compared to other platforms I consider that  becomes expensive at the end of each billing making the ROI not so attractive so the automations end up being a little more expensive than you would thinkThis platform is ready to carry out simple automations so if a more advanced automation is required for a greater and more personalized resolution of problems then it will be necessary to have programming knowledge to be able to handle the appropriate tools such as the APIs of the platforms to which you want to connect to perform automations It will not be easy although it is well documented how to work with code within  it will require an expert in this field to perform these complex tasks A major hurdle in convincing the management was the standalone cost for  which was per user In the gambit of tools available like atlassian tools A standalone tool though extremely superior falls short because of lack of other tools like wiki chat etc that comes packaged together2 Reports Though they are customizable charts and report templates would surely help in competing similar products
 There must be enhanced channels of client interaction A brandnew radically different upgrade appeared suddenly It completely threw us off schedule Because of problems with their notifications weve been looking for an alternative platform
 The technology does not appear to be powerful enough to manage intricate tasks While the layout is nice it lacks information about their community Despite reading and experimenting with the product complex questions remain
 Collaborative work is currently one of the main principles of modern companies With  we can establish an initial workflow invite collaborators to participate in our work area and increase productivity consistently making constant changes to increase our level of efficiency
 The integration should be done directly by the user without the need to involve the  Dev Team
 I didnt like is that we are not allowed to change the colours of the tool 
 I miss some native features like a connection with Google Calendar a time control about how long it takes to finish an activity and others
 Id like to have a better system to create approval and escalation processes
 Automations could be improvedAt a certain point I needed that when a parent card was moved from a phase the child card in another pipe be moved from phase as wellHowever we were unable to do this with the automation options available in 
 All the flows have to be created from a preformatted template or from the zero There is no an addaptation we can do from a sheet or another software we have used for example It would help a lot if wewanted to migrate from another platform to 
 Hard to say I have some specific considerations about some tools like the expiration date I believe it could be for hours and not with a fixed date But in general I like all the platform This is my second time aroundand the experience of modeling and going live is not what it was like two years ago for the first project They give you x amount of hours to model your pipes Zoom calls go against it their strategizing time goes against it bug fixes goes against it that was the biggest turn off Their developer designed our pipe with a major fundamental flaw and they refused to fix it {actually ignored my emails for weeks} unless I purchased more hours at $125 per hour Its this perpetual loop they throw you in which constantly costs you money I was not open to paying this so decided to figure it out myself but was not able to as the developer designed it in a way where their own support team couldnt figure it out So basically my project was taken hostage  They give you no documentation on the architecture and just basically throw you in the ocean  to sink or swim and will throw you a $125 p h life boat if you wanna ride Other than that they are closed ZERO support after hours weekends and Brazilian holidays This is 2022 I do not know of another Saas that rolls like this?Even during biz hours its a 90 min turn around Workato is an amazing integration tool but thats pricy also 075 cents a ping  with most processes needing  calls to accomplish the goals
 Having more integration of the different features within  would be appreciated Having the automations for a single pipe for example be accessed and controlled from within the pipe would be more efficient than having to find them amongst the list of automations in the automation sectionReordering fields within the start form could also be improved if we were able to click and drag them or type in a number to reorder them Right now we have to move fields up and down with arrows which can be very time consuming when adding a new field that needs to go near the beginning of an existing form 
 There are two features that while present are not yet sophisticated enough to meet my needs The first is reporting specifically at a company level which neither allows you to report on custom fields nor create a truly custom action insight dashboard Weve used s robust API to remedy this but most users wont have this capability so a builtin connector to an analytics suite would be ideal Secondly is the calendar app   missing timeline function While Google Calendar integration allows you to view singleday events it does not allow for a timeline view Again here the API can be used to solve this and Im told that a gant chart view which would address this use case is coming soon
 It would be nice to be able to make certain changes to individualize each process within your pipe with different colours to make the visual of each process be more defined 
 the app could be better involvement from installers is necessary to take full advantage but thats more of an organization issue rather than an issue of the product 
 I wish I could integrate it into other software more I would like to see added the ability to add functionality that lets me choose how individual phases of a pipe are organized first to last last to first alphabetical type of card together etc I can only adjust on the entire pipe level of earliest to latest and vise versa I need to be able to do that on the phase level
 The ONLY thing I dont like about  is that you need to pay the highest rate to have user roles I have lost work a few time because all of my team has admin role and that is bad
 When you delete a field from the  we lose the historical from the previous pipes We should keep the changes just for the news pipes but dont erase anything on the old pipes They should have someone in the support team that speaks Spanish Because some of my colleagues dont speak English so I need t help them in the communication with  support team
 Its not so simple to find information about all the integrations API etc There are just a few tutorials but this is just a non developer opinion 
 Ease of use has been difficult I had to research and look at so many webinars to understand most of what I know It was worth it though Support staff is really helpful and patient while guiding you through this process thus its difficult to track down right now They give you the opportunity to fail which helps you learn how to utilize  better This technology might be difficult to grasp and use at first but it is worth the effort in the long run Because the expiration date is established by a date on the calendar I would want you to have an option to select a time and in working hours but there isnt one available
 I noticed there are no demonstration videos picturess for beginners Adding demonstration pictures videos will help new users have a better understanding of the range of services and amazing features offered by pipefyAlso  lack to ability to serve as a communication tool between employees like Slack For instance employees cant have personal communication using  slack offers this feature
  has a few items that could use some upgrades and they are currently working on theseIn general they involve the siloing of features by pipe or processFor example if you develop a group of email templates they can only be used with a particular pipe or business processAlso the development of PDFs that will represent the information in narrative formis a little clunky but certainly doable
 Some features that i would like to see in  is Time control could have some  Apps that generate time report of taks and usersExport Database One thing that I would like is be able to export Database data with just one Button I needed this tool a lot of times and I had to write an script to do this using the GraphQL Api
 There are just a few details than  could improve as Use math formulas on his formsCalculate the real time use on a process it only calculates the time on the pipe of a card
 Maybe should have a sum for the total in money currency we set up in the top of each step pipeline steps
 The big issue is that we dont see useful the Database feature We have tried tu use it but we cant export the dataWould be really nice if we can share using an iFrame or something a list of entries with a filter from database For example I have an Events Database in  and I would like to share in my web site the Upcoming Events To achieve this Ill need not only the iFrame to share but a filter to show only upcoming event and not past events Also I would like to show some data not all data from the Database In another words will be useful something to make queries to the database inside Another issue is that I think Its a heavy software to run in old computers I think it uses a lot of recourses in the user machine JS or something and old computers gets slowAlso I would like to get a better mobile App It works ok but I have a lot of trouble with conditional fields in the Apps
 The main reason I quit using it was the lack of integrations To be fair that was a bit ago and theyve got more integrations now than they did before but still quite far from Trello May not be a problem for many though It was for me due to specific needs but may not be for you Also I question myself on its privacy as the  staff contacted me for some free online courses probably because I worked at Dell at the time and they wanted to mention in their site that its used there too in the videoconference they even mentioned the title of one of my boards
 The app is not very easy but they are improving it
 I miss having more options when creating automations being able to pull information from connected cards make calculations or bulk editsAnother missing point is that not all fields are searchable making it hard to find a specific card if you didnt mark all fields as subtitles when you have hundreds of them in the same pipe
 Automations require a new UX maybe something related to path creations with several steps Today is limited and has some fails to deploy start that frustrate the workflow creator Emails are a nice feature inside cards but it lack the flow of an inbox that would make a shift from sending a note to someone related to this card to actually managing email inside  with all cards information available to interact
 The reports is very poor the user dont have any kind of graphics and you cant bring data from two different pipes I think the internal team dont like to improve the software frequently and implement new features
 Lack of built in functions like conditional logic and mathematical operations Some new updates bugs sometimesIt can be tricky to do some automations Lack of some easy to implement features eg importation of spreadsheets is painful no way to clear all records on a databaseThe API documentation is really messy and even as a developer I get lostThe mobile app is a huge mess and the only really lacking part of the UXWeb interface could be more responsive
 There are no problems getting started the only drawback is that there is a learning curve associated with the platform Once you understand the reasons behind it it works fine
 For a smaller company is hard to configure automations upload of database and things that need some sort of programing Even with all tutorials for someone that never read or did anything of programing it was really hard to do everything neededMaybe because our process are complex we had a hard time and still do to configure everything perfectly even with support help
 Sometimes its scary to think in all the detailed configuration we have to do to made it work the way we want
 Absence of functionality to handle calculations and control resource consumption storage automation etc
 Its hard to implement and theres a high learning curve for new users Creating new pipes and making them work our way is not so easy as we expect
 I can accidentally move a card by slipping past it too quickly in the pipe BUT it alerts me that it moved so I have a history and can correct the error
 As we use  for controlling all of our processes there are some features only available in major plans that would be very nice for us to have but the price is prohibitive for now as a small business specially due to exchange rates 
 The dashboards have a lot of bugs and because of that I lose a plenty of time transfering the data of the reports to Excel Id like to not have this mechanical work anymore by having improved  dashboards
 The only thing that might help clients be more successful at utilizing all of the benefits of the platform is if you had the ability to do an inperson consultation with administrators to ensure that their pipes are developed how they need them to be and answer all hanging questions as it starts to be usedIt would be helpful if a card were in a phase without being acted on if there could be some exponential alerting Perhaps this is available I just never discoveredThere is a steep learning curve to thinking like a pipe
 Sometimes if Im working quickly  cant keep up The best example I can think of is changing a date within a card saving but then not seeing that change reflected 
 I wish there were materials for making dashboards Other elements such as automation might make some activities easier to do Email tools require a few extra capabilities and resources for developing email templates with better styles They have certain tight restrictions that even a corporate account cannot change The builtin reporting feature doesnt let you report on connected database records so you need to either create a field on the card that syncs itself to record or create your own reporting view as a  App You can only filter the cards by Label or Assignee so you end up using labels for things where a dropdown list would have been nice Which means you can end up with a lot of labels and may need to namespace them IE Location NorthSide JobType Custom LeadSource Web etc
 It could be improved cards conexion between pipes so one card created in one pipe can be consulted or viewed in another pipe with some critical information
 I think some features could be less by hand and be smarter like when we move cards to a phase and it should change the person whos responsible for that phase but it just doesnt do it and I always have to do it manually
 The customization process is a bit long and not so friendly Although it gives you many tools the UX is not very smooth as you need go back and forth to different screens Reporting is not simple or as customizable as the design of the boards It gives a lot of information but its quite hard to compress it into a meaningfull dashboard We had to combine different apps to create our own dashboard Also its mobile app is not as complete as the web app version 
 Its expensive I dont like that its pricing per user
 We can build lots of different reports but were not able to do basic maths with those numbers It would be good to automatize and generate more functional reports 
 Poor data analyses difficult to connect to others softwares
 For the things i use none come to mind They do great job on creating e manting the software
 Ive been using it to start a recruiting a campaign and I had to label the participants between male and female I noticed its very hard to label one by one You have to click each card individually click on labels then click on the gender Im a user of Todoist and I reckon you could use a similar feature to them I expected to right click the card and see  options such as add comments select label instead of my browser options such as reload page save page copy paste etcAlso I do not like how many times the notifications pop up in the page After I see it the first time they shouldnt keep popping up every time I switch to the  tab
 Difficult to get good examples and way to operate the system 
 Some features that we need to implement to have a better do not exist For example I needed to duplicate the pipes with their automations and rules It turns out only the shell gets duplicated So I needed to do all the work regarding the automations ans rules again
 Some automation lag but I am in Africa so the delay is most likely from my side 
 It can be difficult to gauge the rate of progress when reporting tasks in real time A long delay is associated with this process which is necessary to ensure all employees have a clear picture of the current state Theres also an issue with the fact that payments are based on users instead of the softwares total cost This would make it easier for more team members to participate in the system and increase participation due to costs I also wish they implemented more advanced features such as performance measurements and scheduling This way they could easily visualize tasks performed and how much time is left before completion
 Sometimes the loading is slow Also moving a card from one stage to another sometimes we have to reload the page as the card vanishes in the mid movement
 Reporting is poorEverything has to be extracted then the real reporting built in Sheets or ExcelWould be very helpful if customer service was 24 hours on the week daysIm in central and by the time im building and using  it tends to be   and CS is gone by then
 Some integrations you will need to pay an extra to use to make your process works as you wish
 Sometimes it is hard to not focus on clearing out  or The Pipe as we call it can be as addictive to staff as social media
 It also appears that I cannot add many users to a single workflow instance The job progress is not updated in realtime since it takes time to report these advances and make them visible to the full work team Although it has a decent interface it lacks information about its community
 Ive encountered a few bugs luckily the customer support was able to help me with those Besides that I think the API documentation could be improved Theyre just small things though
 A dificuldade de automatizações e necessidade de buscar muita informação pra atualizar 
 As vezes fica um pouco complexo a alteração de detalhes e demais configurações
 Cards dont always update for all collaborators in a versatile way and it is necessary to wait a while for this to happen The team had a little difficulty adapting to the tool but after a few weeks of use everyone agreed that the companys evolution and growth is remarkable
 Due to the amount of technical features and functions that are often confused processes become disorganized and lost in the middle of use
 As it is a very complete solution it took us a while to understand where to find some tools because we had a simpler need
 not great for projectsonly has a Kanban viewbills every new member of the account right away would be easier to always pay at the end of month
 the promotions offered by the software as well as the price charged and are according to my needs
 Havent found anything that i least like for me this software is still a good option to use
 Difficult to answer do not have what I do not like because everything is very easy and with the support custumer service always giving us a solution
 No series complaint with the Platform as it is really easy to useTrying some of the complex queries to see the limit of the tool but i am sure it will meet our expectations
 No ability to mass start projectsNo ability to us and or on reportFiltering felt clunky
 As a Brazilian user the worst part for me is the value for money considering the company is also Brazilian but charges only in US dollar which makes it somewhat expensive
 I has so many uses that I dont even know and a think that I dont like is that I wish I could use all the functions without having to look so deep into it because it would be easier It is easy to use but if you need something more complicated you need to study the software a lot to get it done
 I have difficulty using integrations with some APIs but the platform has several help forums
 O preço poderia ser diferenciado para países com moedas mais desvalorizadas como o Brasil por exemplo
 It can be difficult to find certain featuresThere is always help on hand but sometimes I think some features could be more easily edited or changed 
 APIsometimes has some bugs that stops the development on my end and technical support is oftentimes escalated a little too late
 Email templates should accept HTML coding its pretty complicated to add your own style for the automate emailing Managing tasks with due date is still a challenge for us The calendar wont mach our needs yet
 Automation in general causes laziness your software is amazing
 Tudo é pago os addons o preço é absurdo comparado com outros serviços concorrentes
 It is a little difficult to learn how to use and explore all its functions
 Its not easy to search for cards on  and sometimes malfunction
 I think so be little bad points how the necessary to create many automations to best experience
 It crashed one or two times
 Time tracking will be a great feature for the future Also a way to start counting time of working on a task automatically and mandatory could help us to have a time tracking in a better way
 Some of the automations are a little bit hard to set up you cant do it on your own without watching or reading a tutorial
 The cost that could be more affordable for the entrepreneur
 The price for sure Its really expensive when we exchange the currency
 unfortunately they do not have calculations involving fields for example if you have a unit price and a quantity you cannot calculate the turnover
 Rencently had presented some bugs in the email footprint
 I cant extract reports very easily I cant extract reports very easily
 The Dashboards They are to simple and even thought is not the purpose of the tool I would like to have some options to build some good visual dashboards
 Some featuresneeds to be improved like the availability to paste itens and transform it ina check list
 The templating tools could be more intuitive When we first started the dashboards didnt exist however in the last  months these have now been launched
 Sometimes its hard to find customization toolsYou need some technical knowledge to do some customizations
 It lacks some features in the database mode that are available on pipes and would be really useful The PDF generator could be more developed and it would be great ir pipes could generate PDF documents instead of only the specific cards The only reason why we dont use the email feature is the gray background it would be great if it was possible to take off while still keeping the powered by  description The app could really use some improvement it is difficult do use in a agile manner 
 Might be a little difficult to understand But once you hot the hang of it its a breeze
 The learning curve is quite difficult and longer than expected
 Only one automation for the free plan is a good way to initiate and learn more about the platform but it probably will not the enough as soon you get more use 
 There are many awesome features like the ability to share a public link to create a card in a pipe that are hidden under the settings page
 Lack of possibility to add workflow for approval processes on global scale lack of possibility to add more forms for one pipe
 There are few native integrations which made us to purchase another tool just to cover this I would say it consume more data There is no option for editing
 sometimes it shows me cards that im responsible for even when i use the filters it happens a lot The Android app is poor automations could have more options
 Reporting can improving providing organizational view and not only at pipe level Sounds this feature is in the roadmap
 More integration with ecommerce platforms would be awesome For Brazil the price in dollar may be a block at this time dollar is more than BRL And the fact theres no brasilian fiscal document Nota Fiscal brasileira available is another difficulty for some companies
 Later could be a integration with LDAP software
 Like a user not administrator I have no features that I dont like
 Sometimes I cant open the software and I dont know why but it works when I open in a anonimous window
 We are havnig just a little problem when we send the service for the client but I believe that we gonna fix this
 The platform is growing day by day so by the momment it has not all the features that could give coverage to a robust process
 Emails inside the cardsIts a good idea but we send a lot of emails template so this option we dont use yet 
 We cant read files post online like word PDF for example we need to download them to see it this took some time from us
 Me ajuda nas tarefas diárias e facilitou na minha organização 
 What I liked most was the cards with personalized steps Very good
 Its sometimes less than intuitive to even find where to make some changes customization and once found some are fairly complicated 
 Importing information from a spreadsheet to create cards not very customizable
 listed tools on marketing materials that are not ready yet
 Honestly for our simple use case it does all we need it to do Maybe getting reminders as a due date approaches would be helpful 
 Tasks organization is hard to use We still need to use other tools to schedule tasks It does not have a good way to view tasks within the cards yet
 I would love to see more improvements with the mobile UX I thought the mobile feature was a little oversold since its not as uptodate as the desktop version 
 Sometimes I miss notifications which can be stressfulIt would be helpful if the notification to a comment or an email should up on the specific  card
 better microanimations tip tutorial mode to see what i have to do next like a assistant mode
 The only con that I have found so far is that once completed the tasks stay in the completed category forever unless I delete them I would like to see a setting to where they would disappear after a certain amount of time 
 Some features like lack of work flows are underdeveloped but I understand that as focus on certain scenarios of software application 
 sometimes it´s slow but this isnot common
 Sometimes the server has instabilities that affect the speed of production
 Some delays in processing new infos when it comes to fill in the cards It takes a lot of time to the automatic tasks happen sometimes it takes  minutes for the card to go to other phase
 Paraa minha finalidade esta sendobem útil e de grande proveito
 Well for me it was a little bit hard to found documents and materials to see where the automations where
 Some features are missing such as Configuring who can or cannot change a card
 Reporting is simple and maybe could use some more functionality featuresOverall the software has been great so far
 There are some features about user and role control that I miss And some triggers that would make my process even more automated
 The basic email adress to send emails from Pipe is very unreliable and often goes to Spam Well have to pay to integrate with Google to improve this
 My only point and real problem is to be billed in US Dollar it makes the solution more expensive and I have to analyze to keep with  Not to change for another program but to go back to Excel program or light ERP offer in Internet ex Sige and Omie
 The need of support to create new flow stage
 Have tried using it for myself my practise but lack discipline to do as I preach
 Speed of creating some new important features dont have company important reports to evaluate performance 
 creating dashboards etc is a little difficult at times 
 Lack of integrations with other softwares
 no form logic no cross pipe email templates or forms no reusable cards
 More native integration option would be the only thing that  needs to improve on
 Couple of bugs API doesnt seem to work at the moment with some integrations as it seems to have been upgraded recently their android app   mobile browser layout is terribleSome aspects of the reporting can be a bit restrictive in terms of filters
 Doesnt have some power ups Im used to in Trello The integration with Slack for example is better with Trello that every change is monitored  only says that a new card was created and by whom
 The price per user is expensive if the employees have access to the pipe to monitor the cards
 Há alguns bugs como no carregamento demorado dos pipes algumas vezes e na falta de tradução de alguns termos na plataforma PTBR Mover os campos após serem criados nos pipes é uma tarefa cansativa
 As always its very hard to find a platform that think on the small users and companies The free plan has very usefull tools but some others are limited only to paid plans
 The export tool that is has it is not very well designed and the email alert that i have setup for overdue application it is not working
 Calendar features lacking at the moment some Zapier triggers to work out
 Sometimes the emails dont go through and the software doesnt send me a warning or a solution to the problem and this can impact the operation badly
 The software still has a path to walk when we talk about refreshing the screen We have to keep refreshing the screen to be sure we are seeing updated cards
 Emails flow Some bugs during use like errors in automatic emails limited flexibility to create new standard documents pdf Dashboards very slow and not friendly to create
 One limitation which was the missing link for usThe Database feature just is ready for primetime yetIts not easy to integrate and import is limited to create onlyno import update available and no bulk deleteWithout these things we couldnt use the database feature which was a requirement for us 
 Smartphone App with very limiting functions Difficulty in exporting data
 very simple and not scalable at the company
 possibility of integrationmanagement dashboards
 More templates They´re useful to inspire new users improve their knowledge At the same time probably a lot of users have tested workflows developed using  to share worldwide Should have a library to share them
 Since it is so open it lacks some features related to more specific work To make a sprint you need to use an App on your board but that app is very limited and lacks the customization of the rest of the product I spent a lot of time fighting the app to make it work closer to what I would like
 It´s necessary to learn how to use it Some hours of some vídeos are enough There are so many features that you have to demand experienced users to accelerate your learning process to use 
 I still have not found anything that could be considered negative but I could have some more features that would make the team always stay on the same platform not having Slack for example
 The interface is not the easiest one to understand in a firts sight But you start to understand it when you use the software
 Not much I wish I could move tickets from one pipe to another existing pipe easier But that is really the only con Other then that it has made my life much easier and we just use the free plan 
 reports and automation could be more intuitive to implement notofications arent the best would like to have more predefined stuff to make it easier and quicker to implement for simple processes with reporting automation etc
 I still have difficulties using SCRUM It could be easier to view instructions for creating another pipe or use an additional tool
 Some people have had trouble working with this platform Some tools were difficult to configure
 I have no complains so far This seems to be the perfect app fir what we need in our company
 Not so simple to configure Not cheap enough to add users
 Difficulty with reports errors and mistakes
 When you is completing a formulary and click in out you lose all informations
 I think I could have notifications via email or app when a startform was answered This would help me know when a briefing was answered by a client
 I do not find it much more difficult since the free option is very complete for several users if what you are looking for is something more robust you already have to pay but even so I do not think it is expensive
 Its a little complex which makes it a little hard to understand all the features and use it to its complete possibilities
 The pipes view cannot be categorized so if u have many pipes will be difficult to organize them Could exist an diagram view of the proccesses
 I have mutliple pipes and would like to copy an entire card and move it to another pipe 
 The customization process could be more intuitive 
 Lack of possilities in accessing the databases No feature included for time registration
 Lack of some functionalities such as data visualization capabilities in reports formula fields when creatingforms and some other minor features
 It´s necessary time to learn a bunch of resources features to take the best from  Patience is necessary to take advantage of all of them
 Not being able to print checklist on each phase or print your board tasks other than exporting via excel It also lacks the ability of copying cards taks from one pipe to another
 Too many notifications I know you can manage that but still like at first i would get email notification on my phone and on 
 Its hard to take outputs of the process like historical comments and some dates inside the process if the team dont have time to work in the API
 Its hard to differentiate how will this integrate with my project management software are they meant to be used together or in place of?
 Tutorials are not sorted in YouTube An Index would be great
 It would be interesting if possible to install in on premise mode with optional cloudmirroring functionality
 So far I have had none against using the software Not all functions are available in the android app but it is possible to use the mobile browser and then everything is solved
 It still developing a lot of functionalities so some are available to use but not fully working The support is still developing
 It would be good if the customer service response time was a bit quickerBut they still get the job done well
 A lot of cards in one phase would require you to really scroll down if you cannot recall the names Need for areas to not be mandatory
 Can sometimes be oversensitive to mouse controls and so cards can be inadvertently moved to the incorrect location
 I miss a time tracking and some tutorials arent very good
 Software works better on ipone I have a androidOther then that its great I am fine with the cost 
 We are using it for a diverse pool of processes that sometimes run in paralell making it a bit more complicated To solve this we are using a lot of automations
 Privileges of the Users I think it need to be a little bit flexible so we could active\deactivate all the options during adding new users
 Reporting needs to improve and data access through another platform still restricted by the APIs where IT knowledge is required many times
 Cant edit texts only move cardsneed to greatly improve the appmany errors after updates
 Novo design do beta é horrível e completamente diferente um tapa na cara
 Would like to know if I can expand capabilities as a CRM emailing etc
 The billing system to more the one user is not clear The mobile app is very very poor The integration with others tools is disable
 Some features are missing in development deploymentSome changes are not possible you need to do it again partially
 Sometimes is too slow and could evolve to a CDP it could be more intuitive and have more integrations We depend on for lots of thingsIntegration
 slow sometimescan loose data if the power goes out without prior notice
 I think it could be a little cheaper since we have some good choices besides  which costs less
 I have no points to complain about so far except for the lack of gantt charts which would make it even more powerful
 Not totally intuitive but close enough just needs some time to work through everything to pick up the UX logic
 Probably enable admin features in the mobile version everything else is perfect I am quite pleased
 At first I had a hard time learning workflow shaping
 The lack of instruments like more exemples of the things that the software produces
 Actually i havent spent so much time trying to learn more functionalities in the software so thats what i got to do
 Can be a bit buggy having to refresh screens also the integration was not simple until we decided just to use zapier There is no search box by name or any other variable on the cards Very hard to find a lead when we have over 200 leads within a Pipe
 I expected that I would have a support Bu t it os much difficult to learn it
 The mobile applicatiom is terrible Poor navigation
 There are some features that will be great but its not done yet
 Sometimes it is complicated to use not very intuitive
 The solutions dont have a database model to conect 
 Navigating around the tasks and pipes is not that user friendly 
 The only thing is maybe if I want to use my own email I need the paid version
 With the little bit of time I had to invest it provides only the most basic features I get the bare bones easily If the software does have more to offer itll take a substantial investment of time to learn and implement
 i missed an app and notifications in real time about the cards 
 Hard to fully understand all the features
 I have some difficulties to personalize some features to the processes I want I think its not a problem of the software but a gap in my learning process about the tool
 It was not immediately clear what to do to create a process checklist and even after searching it was much easier to use the other software I had been considering
 Not that good when modeling loops and subprocesses In processes where its needed to split the tasks its also not the easiest way to present it
 the only negative point I think is the price of the product
 Database lacks features to make it a useful complement of the pipe system calculated fields lookuplike function etc Some weird design decisions can make the set up confusing connected fields vs connected cards field synchronization access writing rules
 Automations could have simplified view sometimes I feel confused with the many automation rules created in a Pipe
 If you have good english level is ok because it works mainly on that language no other big cons or issues practice a lot and you will defeat cons
 The customer support is very unresponsive and not cooperative Also its not possible to remove the branding in all mails Mail integration is buggy 
 card tracking and reporting for basic users
 The software could has the funcionality to draw processes using BPMN notation It could be a great improve to the software in the future
 The price could be a little lower especially for a single user The free version could have more features
 Besides it isnt a software feature I can say the price is the thing I like least Doing payments in USD isnt easy for who lives in Brazil
 The display If you have a process too large it would be a little difficult to visualize Few options to automatize actions still The impossibility to set an own ID numeration
 After they failed to perform Iknew I wouldnt be able to get my original payment back but I did not expect them to continue to charge me
 UI is not very smooth Lags most of the time Controls can get complex pretty easily
 I can not split pipes into folders to organize myself better by areas It would be better to visualize
 Too many notifications Locked out of certain boards
 Although is a very useful platform it can be expensive for some companies Pricing plans can be quite high especially for smaller businesses Also while the platform is easy to use it can take time to learn how to use all the available features and tools
 Unlimited customisation is a daunting thing when you actually start thinking about how you want your interface to work Thankfully our systems engineer was able to take our wild ideas and show how they might actually look If we didnt have their help it would have taken us a great deal longer to get the setup anywhere near usable The biggest con is the way they have backed my company into a bad position We had a rep that helped us get a plan that worked for our company tailored to us Quick base just came back this year and stated we needed to double our user count and were going to see a price increase on top of user count So the tailored plan we started with in 2018 was no longer available We tried to work with Account Rep to no avail We are now in the process of switching to another vendorSo if you are a small business looking into Quick base my word of advice is STAY AWAY They get you using their platform then you see the price hikes later like in the middle of a pandemic Good business model Disgruntled Database Admin A revamped user interface for the form building tool is long time The full version has not yet been released although it was showcased at Empower 2022 on mobile devices should be on par with whats available on desktop More customization options for mobile product displays are needed
 One of the things I like least about is that it can be difficult to integrate with existing business processes It also can be challenging to set up custom forms and reports Additionally the mobile access feature is not as robust as I would like it to be Additionally there are some features that I feel are missing such as the ability to customize the user interface
 Search options of projects and sub folders can be even better Needs to improve Documents management features Not as intuitive as some of the competitors sometimes it takes  menu clicks to get where youre going
 The thing that scares people about is that it is so unlimited in what it can do Users can build process flow CRM inventory management personnel onboarding and construction project documentation apps the possibilities are endless That can be a bit scary for a prospective new user who only wants one thing and they want it nowThey might not have the patience for a platform that can be everything to everyone in their company And yet adaptability is what makes so great Users can knit together widely disparate parts of their company on the single platform with worldclass ease of use
 was a little difficult for me to navigate Certain features were difficult to locate and the user interface was not very intuitive Furthermore the interface was unappealing making it difficult to find what I was looking for quickly
 There is a bit of a learning curve to understand all of its features or how it can help your business 
 is expensive especially the more users you have Some features require paying a higher price each month Quickbases biggest downfall is if you have the apps customized to do something in your organization ie barcode scanning or advanced reservation capabilities then that section of the app will have advanced programming language that you might not be able to edit Our company doesnt have app programmers so since our app was customized to make significant changes wed need to shell out big bucks to one of their thirdparty developers or wed need to have a staffer who could make changes However different companies have different workflows so there have been instances where even customer support couldnt make a change to what the thirdparty developer created so your own companys programmer might even be at a loss This was very frustrating for our company since we were led to believe wed invest more money upfront and then just pay to maintain the software and have the support we needed so the app would grow with our company not end up costing more if we needed changes If youre a big corporation with lots of money this is probably the way to go but if youre a small company you might want to think carefully before investing in for anything requiring customization Some items that could be better include ability to identify duplicates ability to easily select an item in grid edit beyond 1000 records we have clients with many many many locations ability to rely on the user groups and have confidence that these users will have all apps added to their My Apps page
 Unlike other work order generating platforms this does not have a chat feature for the person work orders are dispatched to and the dispatcher integrated within the system
 They also do not have a native generic Sync to OBCD databases They recently rolled out Sandbox functionality but there is still no dev environment the sandbox is the dev environment QB also disallows scheduled automations of table to table copies if you have Sandbox enabled Big problem Cannot remove the default Create New App link that everyone sees when logging in the homepage This means every new user clicks it and admins get a million notifications of Joe wants permissions to create apps from every new user
 Just like any other platforms in the market this platform is constantly evolvingAreas where I think can improve more is its nativereport generation capability More chart types and more widgets you can fit in the dynamic dashboard within its native capability is a welcome improvement
 is feature rich but it is not the prettiest software Ive ever used While I do appreciate the simplicity the UI UX might be a turn off for new users just learning the ropes 
 This software lacks a lot of features that should be integrated and contacting support can be a pain This software would be ideal if it intertwines more aspects that would allow users to send information to others and let other users access features and timeframes We had to print out each form and attach them which was very old school and time consuming 
 When it comes to paper receipts documents I feel like there could be something for transferring documents through maybe taking a picture for your phone Not everyone has a scanner that they know how to use and now days taking a picture on your phone is far more accessible
 There is no API features and tickets cannot be associated with each other or dependent on each other
 There are some limitations restrictions that dont allow for as much customization as we would likeAt times we have to hire a programmer to help us customize features to get more out of the data that we have stored in there Lack of support for specific characters of the Portuguese French Spanish language such as ç é è ã etc This made it impossible to use email synchronization tools we use gmail and even sending emails through the tool has problems with those characters It is very bad to send an email with the name of an unconfigured company just because it has a simple care Im not asking to translate the tool but only to make it usable by countries that do not use English alone Because this does not allow us to use 100% of the tool my note will not be 100% either
 We cannot customize any color of the field or use any background Here we have to use the background made by 
 Wish I had more time and knew more to customize the templates with my organizations branding but as a backend management system This product is perfect right out of the box 
 The lack of functions needed unless customizedUnless you have an IT person onboard or handy it is unlikely that you will get the results you want without creating other issues We had a dedicated employee with QB experience to work on QB buildout only and even she had difficulty creating and modifying to make the program work for several different divisions within our company all with different needs
 Its very expensive for SMBs unless you use this platform on a daily basis
 While is a powerful tool Ive found that the subscription cost can be a hurdle for some organizations Some advanced features may also require additional support from a platform expert which can increase costs To really make the most of there needs to be someone with high technology literacy to set everything up and troubleshoot It can be used simply but only if your needs are simple and will probably be more than you need if youre just looking for sales tracking or similarThough not difficult adding new data points can be extremely time consuming In a small workplace it really does matter if someone needs to spend several days entering data into the same forms hundreds of times across different apps Obviously this will vary depending on what the needs areIt takes a lot of clicks to get somewhere A minor issue really but I find it irritating to have to 10 things to get what I want because the search function isnt particularly sensitive
 does not provide a ton of customer support They rely on an incredible community of users and developers as well as approved Solutions Providers QSPs that customers can contract with for help with building their applications But if youre looking to go at it on your own you will have to dig if you need help with something As savvy of as user I am it took me three years before I even learned that I had an account manager at Quickbase Reports are not easily formatable So if you want to send out reports to your clients or internally within the company you would have to resort to 3rd party tools to allow for such functionality Im hoping that will work on this particular aspect of their reporting in future releases
 One of the drawbacks to is the cost While it is a comprehensive solution it can be expensive for some businesses Additionally the app development process can be a bit cumbersome and timeconsuming
 Quickbases pricing can be expensive particularly for smaller businesses or those with limited budgets Additionally there can be a learning curve when first using the platform as it offers a wide range of features and customization options However provides extensive resources and support to help users get started and make the most of the platform
 There are a few minor cons however I will not write them as they are mainly just pet peeves of mines I would say one con is it will take some time for a new user of this software to start building applications Now I am not saying this is a long process if the person is willing to learn they will learn rather quickly also offers what is called University user can join this online training course to help rapidly learn how to use this software
 The app takes you through multiple steps to save add or edit an app page When it comes to process this app will make you click Edit then once you enter your data you have to click save The premier users or platinum users is ok but when you try to speak to them all you get is good luck going else where  The fact is they will lure you in but lets face it once you move your database in they count on you not moving it out Since is a lowcode platform developers are only allowed to do what supports without resorting to code Dont misunderstand there is a lot you can do with natively but if you want to add a feature that doesnt have native support then you may find yourself building very complex data structures or simply resorting to programming to get things doneThe UI looks like it fell out of the 90s but I understand that several recent updates and several planned updates are changing this in good ways
 Convoluted poor customer service slow loading tables
 Integrations and automations are extremely powerful tools that exponentially increase the value of but the switch from automations to pipelines presents a major issue in that pipelines are not intuitive or easy to use for the lowcode manager Without an easier to understand interface and or much better documentation and support the elimination of automations in favor of pipelines could be a major detractor from the usefulness of quickbase
 Inability to take more the three attachments for a particular project seems space limiting for larger endeavorsLimited number of user licenses means only certain people can use create tickets 
 Its not super user friendly and there are limited bells and whistles Its not well connected to other services or applications that we use google and trello as examples of what would be useful but are not included for this application 
 They are working on this but the front end often receives complaints for looking too plainAlso the summary aggregation reports are in need of some TLC and adding more functionality for picky executives who want things to look a certain wayI hope the attention they are putting into the very nice looking graphs and charting options is turned to Summary Reports soon
 I didnt see any least in quickbase as manager this is the product that we need in our program and it helps me a lot
 Being a company steeped in visual design the look of isnt the most exciting out thereWe wish there were more options to customize the look
 Reliability on services is sometimes difficult If something breaks you will need to understand what is broken and alert Quickbase There is only so much you can troubleshoot before waiting on QB
 Unfortunately profiles as easy as they are to create are very easy to delete and screw up You can manipulate security access and such but if someone makes a wrong move and deletes a profile or worse a FIELD youre in trouble ALL of that data will be lost if that happens It would be nice to have an automatic backup of some sort just in case but we did not find that to be an option in our testing and use of the product There are a few odd quirks as well for instance you may have to create relationships that are multifaceted or backwards to get profiles to talk to each other Sometimes that feature is not as intuitive as you might hope
 There are many columns in the job page that will not show up on the quote that are crucial to customer reading it ex UOM User has to be detailed in description instead of relying on the unit of measurement column
 With power and flexibility comes a lot of complexity isnt just a single software platform its a whole tech ecosystem which can be a bit overwhelming to a new userI think some progress can be made in the user interface to make it more intuitive for beginners like me That said Ive been able to find my way and Im sure you will too
 One of the things we didnt like about was the lack of userfriendly features While the platform is powerful it can be quite difficult to set up and maintain The learning curve might be a bit steep for less techsavvy users so they may need assistance in getting accustomed to the software Additionally there are limited customization options for the look and feel of the applications created in QuickBase
 Theonly issue I have had with this is customizing reports that I have already created It took me a little bit of time in order to find out how to do it and when I tried to do it again I had forgotten how I had done it before Maybe its just me but this is not a clearly labeled feature 
 The price was raised per userWe are not a huge company so the price jump almost caused us to discontinue useSupport is great but it would be nice to get in touch with them immediately instead of having to open a case and wait to hear backThey typically respond the same day and can resolve the issue but they can only resolve one issue at a time The pricing and licensing makes it tough to get started This is a tool that would benefit from a large store of appsLike a connection to Asana or Trello the ability to push GPS coordinates from a cellphone for field service operations etcIts hard to get started developing these because they dont have developer accounts and the trial is only 30 days long Unable to define complex business rules Only when entering the form rules about the fields of the table can be defined Required field amount must be greater than 100 etc
 The User Interface is a little confusing to navigate initiallyTo counteract this we put together an instructional presentation and had our team members perform a brief exercise to ensure they were well equipped 
 The fact that anyone can create an application We have many abandoned applications however with some planning and rules put in place this is an easy solve We also like it for project management however have found to use other collaboration tools that allow to do things more quickly such as leaving a comment checking things off as done as well as some file version control all things doable in QB however we had some issues with the team doing the admin work of updating Using a different tool then tying it to QB is the solve that worked for us
 The learning curve can be difficult on training stages but once the team is comfortable using the platform there are no major complains
 I wish it had a history check feature so we could see who edited a entry when it was done and what was changed
 The platform itself is well built however the improvements on allowing many more solutions to be integrated on this platform could be better It has served our company just fine for now though
 Constant error messages after editing your data
 User interface not great our organisation has struggled with uptake due to the reasonably spartan and functional user interface
 should provide more training and or tips that are easy to find and follow without having to pay for a seminar
 Reports are difficult to format There are thirdparty tools that allow for the functionality of sending reports to your clients or within your company The reporting aspect of is something Id like to see improved upon
 You could take a picture of your receipt or document and save it on your phone which would allow you to transfer it to another device Taking a photo with your phone is now more accessible than ever before even if you dont have access to a scanner
 There could be some nicer features with file attachments bulk uploads and downloads come to mind
 I wish there was more help from QB regarding app building rather than contracting out services When you need guidance and direction they should be able to help you on the spot to create and correct your app to get you up and running
 The program is not intuitive to use and feels like little real live support is given in helping you after you are initially set upThe cost also increased on us and Im not sure I feel the value fits the cost but it is the best solution I can find in the market right now
 when you are up loading files at certain times of the day IE mid morning and afternoon it takes a long time to uploaddocs to the site some times it times out or you need to restart the process again  this would be the only con i have about this product 
 The time to build out the applications correctly and the amount of training needed to use this software
 The support team is not very efficient The only provided method of contacting them is through emails which take several days for a response Other queries need to be dealt with the Solution Providers Price only 20 users for mid size plan This system is oriented to improve teamwork within a company I miss a platform like this to interact between the company and its customers
 The only thing I wish it did is remind me before I move on from a lead to click the call boxsometimes I forget to mark it to track that ive made the call for the day 
 Certain features are lacking such as No availability to just choose a color for a field and or textIf a field is required and not chosen an error message is generated but it does not take you to that field On large databases this is cumbersome
 The software works well for me I did not find any difficulties with the software
 Reporting is very difficult and requires extensive knowledge of how the Apps are built 
 The basics of the program are low code But if you need to do anything complex you either cant do it or you have to create formula fields that require a lot of code and sometimes dont work 
 The software only sends a prompt when you manually ask it to it does not prompt the team member if they are running low on time tocomplete the task
 The tool is a good fit for a small user baseThe cost and quickly outweigh the benefit if the user count gets too largeI would like to see a better enterpriselevel offering
 The graphics capabilities are less when compared to other applications The absence of regular audit trails
 It took a while to get it set up because our platform has many layers but after it was done there have been no cons
 The development sandbox is not a true sandbox because changes are not easily promoted to production Licenses are considered expensive so we have to limit the number we provision at our company
 Not very pretty to look at but thats not really a big deal 
 That is is internet dependent If a server goes down all work has to stop The same thing stops if its overloaded
 While it does integrate with Quickbooks desktop version we often ran into sync issuesWe are now on Quickbooks online and it integrates seamlessly
 As I notice sometimes when task status notification not worked properly but its not a major issue it happens rarely
 It requires me to input some information that is not really needed for resident information for example their college year in school and major
 It flexibility is also its downside as we have to make all of these changes manually This can sometimes very often be time consuming and forces a few of us to work late hours in order to meet the demands of leadership Pretty expensive if you are only  or  users youll have to find a way to combine efforts with other users if you are a less than  man shop
 When the network goes down it affects functionality across the board for us We use Quick Base for pretty much everything in our office
 Space gets tight quickly if using this system as an enterprise software solution Be sure to calculate in ADVANCE to accomodate your budget
 Some of the more advanced features may require more training or expertise to fully utilize and the pricing can be a bit steep for smaller businesses or teams
 The cost is prohibitive I would like to add in more clients to submit data but have had to refrain due to the cost
 Im a big fan so not much negative to say maybe could look a little nicer?
 You need to have a base knowledge of databasesThe software is not drag and drop Overall great product though
 My team was trying to use QB for project management within a Marketing teamits not rocket science However my team didnt have anyone technical enough to customize the product for us on the fly We enlisted a single person consultant but after the consultants project was complete we didnt have a user with advanced knowledge to assist us in any changes The product wasnt intuitive enough for us to customize ourselves and found that over time team members wouldnt collaborate on a project within QB because they found it too difficult or the interface wasnt intuitive
 Pricing could be a bit better A bit on the pricey side By sides paying by user I would prefer a lump amount Some users dont use it as frequently as others
 The thing I like lease it the editability of the app It can often be hard to cater the app specifically to my needs rather than what is generally needed
 Limits in Modern design aestheticsNeed to update dashboards and include more ability to customize the lookWe are Using React to achieve this goal It costs about 10x more than most of its more recent competitors
 Im not sure how much is Quick base Octo but this system seems more cumbersome for what it is The state government uses this system for inputting stormwater information and it is a big pain to do Sometimes the correct sections dont appear until after you submit then you have to go back and redo Everything should appear at once The logic is off Also it is easy to miss buttons and some input options It is also really slow
 Graphical reporting is not much advanced and I prefer to link QB to Business Intelligence tools for dashboarding
 User functionality is less than idealIf it is used purely as a backend database it is fine but using QB forms make the user experience difficult to manage
 UI customizations are limited without custom code Cant create alternate keys or foreign keys not based on primary key values
 The mobile site could be improved with a more consistent experience for users
 There are a few current limitations such as the ability to easily support eastern charactersHowever they seem committed to listening to user feedback and building regular enhancements into their product road map
 Improved mobile app Increased branding whitelabeling
 Do not expect to be a replacement for businesslevel Accounting software such as QuickBooks although can be integrated with Accounting software in different ways
 Podria ser un poco más intuitivo para mejorar su rendimiento 
 I wish there was more explanation of each of the choices to jump to That gets confusing If it could be more simple in terms of choices it would be helpful
 Your data has to lend itself to a tabular format or wont really be useful
 Some features are locked to platform level
 its a little pricey if you only use the toolset to solve a single issue You cant always get things to visually look the way you want to Everything is bad Reminds of a little 1990 websites when you had to do it all an know code or hire someone to know code Should have went with Monday
 I found it a little complicated to use There are almost too many functions filters reports that it was a little overwhelming to learn It didnt organize in the most basic ways
 There are many featuresI feel I need additional training to make the software beneficialI wish they offer complimentary training
 Sometimes requires things that are unneccessary or time consumingReport names could be clearer so you know what youre looking for
 There is a bit of a learning curve to design an app properly It helps if you have feedback from all the stakeholders
 The pricing connection between the tool and the other one at our disposal appear to conflict
 The reporting tools were a challenge for the majority of my team to use
 Wish that we could have projected project hours to help our managers gauge billable hours for ongoing projects
 It crashes when you update and we dont always get notifications of when an update is going to take place
 Creation of multiple tables to enable different form options makes it cumbersome at times
 Need better automated performance management across sites lacks multilingual support which is highly required Multiselect dropdown is a musthave Licensing cost compared to other vendors is high
 Only problem I saw was that if the application is left idle it hangs and needs to be restarted to be able to search for scenarios by scenario number
 There was little room to be proficient aka one call uploaded at a time no dashboard features
 Your logoThat just about about covers it
 We felt as a small company that it was too robust of a program and too costly for what we needed
 Its not very convenient to use tools are navigated to difficult places and it takes a long time to adapt the entire interface 
 I wish updated more often Every once in a while it would be good to see if they can add any additional features that would be useful 
 I would love to see a better phone and tablet application Its functional but its very limited in what you can do I end up going into it through the website 
 There is no calendar function which would have proved to be useful when needing to keep important dates in mind at least I could never find one There is still some need for manual inputs if you need things updated on a monthly basis etc
 I wish there were more training available for this great tool
 The one thing I dont really care for is the filtering options Sometimes I have to scroll for days to find what I am looking for Despite my rave reviews of their customer service the actual CS portal is not goodAlso there isnt much in the way of training with QBI had to learn everything on me own either reading the manual bothering CS with 1000 questions or using the community pageI would love to have had some classroom style training The product needs improvement on the performance side especially when the data tends to grow more than 2000 records in a table Its high time for them to build a multiselect drop down more flexible and adjustable UI with support for more colors schemes and themes
 I would like to see a merge feature as companies merge or buyout locations to clean up our system as we go along Editing is fairly simple but time consuming 
 The reports are clunky and not intuitive to customize Sometimes several reports must be pieced together and downloaded to Excel to obtain the data needed
 For such an advanced and responsive software platform the look and feel can be rather plain even institutional which can work against the creativityfostering environment one wants to create within for individual and team projects
 There are not many things I can consider a con against except the code pages should have a WYSIWYG editorCoding in plain text is not fun
 My main complaint has been that the API doesnt give you enough access to the full capabilities but that will soon be addressed in an upcoming release
 I cannot find a negative point at this time
 With an out of the box application it is not simple to complete every dig down into data that is feasibleWith the data being so readily available parsing it more simply to meet my needs would be more beneficial that the Out of the Box does not inherently support Entry price for premiere is highly restrictiveIf they lowered the required users to 10 $250 a month instead of 20 for premiere they would dominate the space Overtime no questions asked
 Needs time for setup of the apps Learning the features could take time
 Initial app setup without prior knowledge of database structure theory can be challengingBut dont let that scare you away
 While they are catching up with future releases there are constant demands from our customers for more cosmetic options for Reports & Graphs choosing to hide subtotals totals column shading more control over what people see when they drill down from reports
 Customer service isnt the fastest Resources isnt that great Def not a deal breaker
 With tons of features it can be difficult to learn especially when someone else initially created the app You need to make sure to fully map out your plan of attack before creating an app or you will end up will a mess of unnecessary fields and data
 Well since its very customizable  I can really do most of the things I need to do Maybe if the interface looked cooler?
 The UI of was not always the most intuitive and it didnt seem to have the same degree of collaborative tools such as in JIRA
 The information and tutorials about are not widely spread For example YouTube classes on functions or advanced tools are not available This is most likely due to the exclusive nature of QuickBase
 The lack of guidance or support around creating calculated formulas within fields as well as the lack of integration to email applications
 Lack of multilingual support Not having some of the miscleneous fields like Captcha some time customization is bit tricky for a very complex functionalities
 The interface seems a little bit of outdated
 Maybe the way it cant be accessed by public users
 Reporting functionalities are lacking
 Its trivial but it would be nice to have more control over the UI For example I would like to use the getting started feature but customized for our end user 
 To me the biggest drawback is some of the consolidated reporting capabilities Recently some newer reporting features have been released and I am not sure if they will meet our specific needs or not just yet 
 The ease of use with folks who dont have a database background or training can be a challenge
 If we had not been early users we would not be able to afford using this in the current way that we doWe are limited to how many users we will allow because of the costThis could be a great tool if there was a way to add unlimited viewers with the permission to create their own significant charts and reports
 There may arise a need to hire a programmer for more complicated needs which increases the cost
 Understanding the customization of the software takes a while 
 The interface could be improved this is not a deal breaker but it could be better
 Integration with other programs wasnt as much of a breeze as I had anticipated Forunately if I need help figuring anything out I can always call customer support
 Uncertainly about who will buy the company from Intuit pricing based on users can be costprohibitive for some
 UI could use a redesign API response format could offer JSON and a little pricey for smaller businesses that want the full advantage of the API and other features that require a minimum user number
 The pricing model is based on a monthly subscription fee which may be too expensive for smaller businesses but despite this its still a good and very useful platform
 There are times when you may feel overwhelmed from the things that you have to make as it takes time to create the app to who you like but that all depends on your patience
 Their native Gantt chart is very limited It would be nice to have a more robust scheduling interface
 No access to track changes and view which users made the changes 
 No phone supportNot enough affordable training availableI dont really know what all is ultimately possible with QuickbaseEverything is too general of a statement
 has a learning curve and users may need time to become familiar with its features and capabilities
 The user experience is really not interested by me a young generations I hope it could be have more templates that fits young users aesthetic 
 Sometimes the interface isnt entirely user friendly and I have to scroll through things I dont need to finally get to what I was looking forAlso I dont see anything to set reminders to follow up on tasks Perhaps its there but my office is in charge of adding apps
 Alignment is justified left which can leave nasty large white spaces and native scripting support is low There is a lot of online documentation but its not nearly as comprehensive and organized as I would like I am always able to Google my issue and find enough information to resolve my issue The last printed book was nearly 10 years ago
 I would like to have more BI tools but thats not what QB is intended to do
 The communication is only onewayWe are never notified if our responses are accepted and there is no way for us to track the status of a ticket that was raised or the status of our submissions
 Mobile Interface could stand to be updatedThere arent currently many options for customizing
 Unless you are a developer you cant customize the look and feel of the apps
 It has taken us quite some time to get it implemented because we have been doing everything in house
 It can take a significant amount of time to accomplish what you want be careful to schedule and monitor the time you spend building modifying tables Third party integration is limited and other companies that provide these solutions are expensive does not have a mobile solutionI cant use for example an iPhone app or Droid based app to access my dataIt can be done but would require a 3rd party
 We have no issues with the vendorThe product has some funky formatting on occasion but thats about it
 Intuit has announced it plans to sell Quickbase which seems like a cause for concern
 Report structure is still a bit silod but that has and is improving
 There are some weird quirks with the platform but theyre fixing them
 I would suggest a bit improved notification lists Multiple email ids for remainders a sent box for tracking etc
 Field Validations is bit trickier Dynamic Rules are limited and getting time lags while executing multiple rules at a time
 Does not currently allow multiple languages eg Japanese Mandarin Cyrillic characters Notifications do not allow for multiple reports in one email They could expand the formula functionality To get the full customization you need to utilize the api on a server as doesnt have a automated systems as of yetformula based programming cannot trigger items
 It takes a lot of programming to get the product to do what we would like it toSome of the features do not work how I would like them tocould be an in house gap or with the productI am still learning so not sure
 Limited advanced functionality after you get the hang of it 
 Access on a mobile device could use some work 
 There are gaps in the help and support files Its easy to learn the basics but to get to the next level is pretty challenging For instance I havent found good instructions on how to set up the formula fields and when I search the community most of the answers are above my headAlso having more offline options would be great Some of my guys regularly work in no service areas
 Software is so customizable that you can back yourself in to causing issues Need to have a very technical background to build the apps Updates are complex and need technical staff
 Sometimes it was buggy when I ran it on an extension monitor I had
 Training tools and not having a one stop shop for certifications trainings for customers
 was a really affordable solution just a few years agoThe price seems high but still lower than the largest competitors
 Custom code Many to Many relations between records
 Adhoc reporting limitations sometimes need to use thirdparty partners consultants to accomplish goals
 Some quirks to learn when customizing but once those are known it really isnt a issue
 Could be a little more user friendly Weve been able to build so many different tools but I wish the interface was a better 
 Havent really had any dislikes in the year Ive been working with QuickBase 
 Learning curve for nontechnical users Easy enough that employees will start creating oneoff applications to fit their exact needs
 The filters in the CRM can get confusing at times I have to constantly check and uncheck the filters to ensure Im selecting the correct option
 Its a bit more complicated that some other programs I have used Not everything is intuitive but once a file is created its very easy to change
 The filtering options are a bit difficult Sometimes I have to scroll for awhile to get what Im looking for 
 QuickBases mobile interface could use a facelift
 Would like to see more report types
 will do well to continue their efforts to get more organic inherent linkages with other platforms That is happening and will make the platform even more appealing going forward
 Those are two different questions has no real document management or content management functionality As for the vendor they have a great product great people and a great visionHowever they do not appear to actual provide thought and direction to organizations design deploying and iterating a custom instance of QuickBase
 May be frustrating if you are used to other reporting tools and functions within those tools Access and Excel VLOOKUPS HLOOKUPS etc Cost can be a little high for smaller businesses
 Dull user interface can be intimidating for newbies 
 Procesos complicados para trabajar a distanciacon gruposde trabajo
 I wish the software is more user friendlyThere should be a help desk or training on reporting which I think in our company lacks usage
 Currently limited in connectivity to legacy systems so this requires customized solutions that are less intuitive than moving from spreadsheets to QuickBase
 Not as customizabe as you might want Some learning curve for nontechnical users
 Only thing I could find that could use some work is that the interface is static and not very customizable to your specific needs
 It can be overwhelming with how many features there are not having a clear format on certain pieces makes it difficult to roll out
 I cannot think of anything at the moment although I have been using in a somewhat limited capacity so far
 Can still be a little difficult for those with fewer computer skills
 does have its limitations in extending its platform through use of codeItd be great to see the site take in user scripts which can behard to manage from a security discussion
 The cascading dropdown menusand webhooks would require more effort to understand how it works However I am only at the beginning stage of using this software
 Unfortunately the ability to customize and its flexibility can be a doubleedged sword as it makes the platform somewhat unintuitive to use
 Pricing structure can be difficult to understand interface takes a bit of time until user can get comfortable lower entry price would be better <$300 month
 We had a lot of issues getting the system set up even adding users to the account We had to rely heavily on work arounds from tech support We ultimately decided to cancel the contract 
 If you dont have a good understanding of your workflow you will be lost before you begin that was us for a while I wish I had more time to devote to this very valuable tool
 The program has a tendency to slow down when there is heavy user traffic which takes away from the quick analysis turn around 
 searches take longer than we feel it should
 Sometimes hard to program
 The integration is helpful but you have to launch from if changes to Zoom or Calendly are needed which can make it a little clunky 
 Cant complain much but there is a learning curve to this software and one needs to try their hands on every feature to fully grasp its functionalitybut with the understanding comes the reward of better results
 To customize it yourself you need to have a bit of technical knowledge I wasnt thereI wish I could use it 
 Sometimes my work orders get lost and its almost impossible to find them even though Im searching the correct criteria
 some categories and searches take longer to findMaybe we need to look into other ways of doing itThere may be upgrades or systems changes that we are not aware of
 Could use a open up a little more to allow for experienced programmers to do more
 I wish it would do its own reporting like exporting data to excel etc I wish there was a way to plug in other information sources to easily compare 
 Develop add ons not easy to understand yet
 I really can not think of anything that I do not like about QuickBase 
 The ability to seamlessly interface data between and other applications may not be perfect but theyre improving that
 Summary report creation is one the area that I expect some more improvements
 The product Could be more flexible with notifications options
 While low code involvement is good for quick deployment its limitation is lack of flexibility on your own customization While Caspio lets you customize some of the look and feel of your app advanced operations visuals are not easy to do and when you can do them they are clunky
 I honestly cannot think of anything I do not like because I do not have enough knowledge about computer programming but I have used other platforms and again Caspio has proven to be the most powerful
 Truly my only complaint is not a bad thing just a choice I wish I did not have to wrap all the Caspio code in separate HTML mostly b c I do not think it is as easy to teach to nontechnical people Most of the organizations I work with need help getting everything set up and launched but then can largely be trained to maintain and extend their Caspio appand while HTML and CSS are not complicated they are not as predictably explainable as the tables and datapage interfaces
 For a more complex workflow and for refinements in display of data one has to learn know about SQL and Javascript
 Caspio backend and task limitation Customization if we want a specific design 
 Simple apps may be developed very swiftly while maintaining high levels of security and quality More complex apps require more capacity and in depth development While this is a low code platform it does not prevent the use of code and with it the possibilities seem limitless And it still has all the benefits of not having to code from scratch ease of use high security etc
 There is a steep learning curve BUT the peak is not high and it wont be long before you are comfortable and moving along building things at a good clipIm also not fond of a cloudonly solution as it is our data and we should be able to replicate backup the data to local servers directly It looks like this is possible with the API however thats only available in the most expensive tier You really have to have a good understanding of your business process and the SDLC to avoid making timeconsuming mistakes
 Its easy to do basic database stuff like forms and reports and nearly impossible to do anything else The lack of design tools is really frustrating You can use their templates but you cant make your own Dont expect to build a site with a custom UX
 There are little things that you need some programming help with like column justification in reports or adding colors but they are minor and the support is out there to help the nonprogrammer get the job done There is no easy backup solutionCaspio allows for  complimentary restore but will charge for additionalIf they allowed the user to self backup and restore this would be a bonus
 Tasks and trigger info Needs more exams of how to do different tasks
 We did lose some of the functionality we enjoyed with Visual BasicHowever after figuring out as many work arounds as possible we do not miss that functionality anymore
 Although Caspio is constantly improving their product and educational material demonstrating how to use it there are always more features that can be added to allow users to control the look and feel of an application or to allow for example more filtering options across tablesHowever there is a balancing act between creating user friendly features and highly customized ones without needing to write additional code to achieve the aim
 As we are doing solution prototypes using MS Access we tend to upload the application database into Caspio to speed up the process when implementing a solution The drawback with this method is that although we can upload tables and data we cannot upload views This is mostly due to the fact that Caspio does not handle views in the same way as MS Access in fact not allowing a few functionalities such as calculated fieldsCaspio over the last few years has come up with means of addressing this shortcoming by adding extra functionalities in database management
 At least in our experience it appeared that Caspio had given little thought to how a credentialed user would navigate from one datapage to the next in a finished application Although there were a couple of rudimentary examples of this they werent professionallylinked to the otherwisegreat engine that Caspio offered As a result we had to improvise our own interface from the ground up When I first purchased Caspio in 2016 I was not able to export in PDF with their updates that is now possible but my only issue is in order to use you have to have the level of Caspio which will cost more moneyThe good thing is if you want a change submit a request  times out of 10 they will update and include with their next release
 Although it may seem to be sort of a contrived response I really cannot think of a criticism of the Caspio systemThe typical criticism of a technology company would be their inadequate customer serviceHowever as discussed above their support personnel are almost always available always knowledge and will always go out of their way to find a solution 
 It was a little difficult to figure out how to get the app onto a websiteI am not trained in coding so I had to learn how to do a lot of things to get the app to work exactly the way I wanted it to
 I have very few issues with using Caspio and any that I have are either minor or get resolved quickly Customization limitations Although Caspio offers customization options it may have some limitations compared to customcoded applications Some advanced functionalities may require technical knowledge2 Cost Caspio is not the most costeffective option in the nocode app development market The pricing plans can be expensive for small businesses or solo entrepreneurs3 Learning curve Although Caspio is a userfriendly platform there may be a learning curve for those with no prior experience with app development tools Your operations regions are siloed If one site goes down your service is unreachable 8x8 does concurrent datacenter streaming for realtime communications across several data centers thats baked into $15 a month that also includes calling to 14 countries at no extra cost video and voice conferencing SMS and a desktop and mobile appWere on an older plan called performance Weve asked to add SAML SSO to our plan because its not offered We were told it would be $400 a month in part because of engineering fees Do you bake engineering fees in the monthly cost for moving customers to a higher plan? How is it that companies like 8x8 can offer SAML SSO for less than $ a month companies like OKTA who specialize in SAML SSO can offer integration into 40 services and customized deployments for $ a month and Micorosft offers SAML SSO as part of their free tier of Azure AD that also includes storage of up to 50k objects? How is it that your engineering and services fees are some of the most expensive in the industry?Pure greed is the answer
 Updating the style of reports isnt as intuitive as Id like it to be but weve found some styles we like and continue to use them for most of our reports and forms
 Cost I have found Caspio to be relatively expensive compared to other lowcode platforms especially for larger businesses or organizations with more complex needsCustomization limitations While Caspio offers a high degree of customization I have found that there are certain limitations to what can be customized which can be frustrating for more advanced users
 If internet is down the software is not usable It is a bit pricy and the biggest issue I have is data storageAs a database it is great although it has a limit in records that I think is low compared to priceBut this data records can be overcome and if need pass on the costBut the data file storage is very limitedThis reduces my capability in being able to provide my customer with applications that also manage their documents I had the need to use other solutions for data storage since my customer needs to upload files for their clients and would quickly run to the limit of 10GBOne important think to consider is my business case where my clients require retention of data for at least  yearsIf they use  or around that GB per year the 10GB will not hold and buying more from CASPIO is expensiveNote similar to this is the SMS but not to the degree of data storageFor SMS I have opted to integrate with Twilio as the overall price for number of SMS made more sense
 I can only think of one issue and that is the complexity of the styles This is one area that I always need help with as the learning curve about styles is too steep for me In the case orf styles I always ask for and receive help from Caspio and I thank you Pricing structure is highly frustrating for a small business user or team Basic paid plans have no access to APIs Zapier or automation importing which is high for the base plan compared to similar apps To get those features the next level jumps over 4x higher Datapages allotted for each plan which is the foundation of the app are misleading since similar competitors use an allowed number of apps Some basic applications in Caspio need 1020 data pages but the basic plan only allows  Ultimately a large amount of time was spent figuring out how to cut out pages and combine features killing user experience Had a bad experience with customer support sales when I accidentally deleted an entire table Was informed that as a basic free trial user they would have to charge me to get the table back even though it existed And days saved was only a few so had to quickly decide They were not sympathetic to my plight even as I was in the evaluation stageIf youre a major enterprise with a large budget and some programmers Caspio may be an ideal solution If youre a small business be very careful when evaluating and Id recommend looking elsewhere The subscription models and definitions are confusing and you may find yourself with an app built during the free trial and realizing you cant possibly afford to launch it
 Some of the features we need are only offered on costly plans
 We got a contract with Caspio to move our auditing program to their program We gave them the current system we use and all the bells and whistles we currently have they said they can do it and that it should be completed within a couple months The program is not complete yet They are claiming we changed what we wanted when we did not and they currently have the google sheet which has all the coding we want except for the auto emails and texts to personnel They are trying to charge us more now to do what they already agreed to do and they will not return our money Do not use them at all please!!!
 There should be a multiple check box feature where the choices can be pulled from other fields Also the rules for conditions are very limitedFor example if you want to disable other check boxes when one check box is selected you will never be able to do another conditional rule for that check box that you have said should be disabledI mean there should be an ability to apply multiple conditional rules on a field But ok bugs is for everyone what really is unacceptable is the total lack of support and collaboration Not only they ask 250$ per hour to give you support but every small thing that goes out of the plan they charge you inevitably if you ask for some small difference they ask you to subscribe the next plan at  times the price Then if you ask to negotiate they are not available Once you are tied up with them they not only deliver less value but they are rigid and unavailable to collaborate The user interface is very dated It looks like it hasnt been updated in 20 years Customer support was appalling Very slow to response and not empowered to take decisionsPricing plans are inflexible and require annual commitment that lock you in for a year at a time regardless of whether you pay monthlyUse of marketing dark patterns to trick you into signing minimum term contracts
 Caspio can be a little to costly for small businesses or startups looking to utilize all of Caspios features
 While Caspio is a powerful platform it can be somewhat complex and overwhelming for nontechnical users For users who are new to coding and application development the learning curve can be steep
 Their limited graphical interface tools limits the user experience you can create When asked for support to customize you are constantly pushed to their development services which are very expensive I never hired them but when I interviewed them to consider hiring their experts I realized they were the same support team members that did not know the answer and referred you to the development team
 Starting out without technical experience it did take some time to learn but we started with the free plan and it was an incredible value worth the time investment to learn There with challenges that the architecture we built as we wanted to grow and change The Caspio support team has helped us solve many of those with creative workarounds 
 limited ability to build on an iPad That would be very useful for on the go adjustments and configurations
 The learning curve was steep The training I went to was helpful but it wasnt until I had been working with the software for several weeks that I finally felt comfortable and confident Im also the tech support for our applications and I find that there are times when it seems Caspio glitches but its hard to tell if its Caspio or some anomaly in the application It can take a long time to troubleshoot It also seems that some browsers have a harder time with Caspio than others
 A lot of promises that are rarely delivered This is not a no code platform You need to have a real developer on the team if you want to produce good applications The Sales and Accounting is sketchy the Account Success Managers are sketchy the best part is the live support Everything else is below par They do not update their standard features and they increase prices all the time
 For new users it can be a bit difficult to manage its diversity of functions
 There is not a standout feature that we dislike Caspio is strong and fully flexible
 The support doesnt seem to be very helpful and at times performance isnt great
 Need a commission tracking system and lead rotation system 
 Not sure about integrating with other systems yet accounting and using on mobile devices Loaded a new and valid credit card which was repeatedly rejected by CASPIORather than someone call me CASPIO opted to suspend account instead which caused critical automated pathways to grind to a halt causing signficant reputational damage and operational chaosTelephonic support insisted on a  digit support ticket number whereas only  digit numbers are providedSpent close to a week trying to get someone in billing onto the phone Eventually managed to pass the credit card details to someone in billing god bless [sensitive content hidden] but the card details were still rejected Eventually Caspios dev team fixed their issue But zero acknowledgement or apologies from Caspio as to what went wrong and whether it might happen again
 The payment processing should have an easier interface and more predefined optionsAlso the ability to allow clients to import data records to a designated table without using scheduled tasks from thirdparty application 
 form design CSS needs improvements  asyncroonousform submission and file upload etc
 Sometimes response time to needed updates or changes can take a bit longer than desired but once addressed the team is very collaborative on keeping us updated on status for updates And there are usually very good reasons for the delays
 I was under the impression that Caspio is a nocode software solution however I must have misunderstood because I have learned that it is most likely a lowcode solution for a vast majority of use cases Basic functions are certainly nocode but most companies are not using Caspio for the basic functions I imagine Because of this there has been a semisteep learning curve for me personally I would consider myself technologically adept but I do not have even a ground level knowledge base of Java script or html language 
 It would be nice if it had more options for the types of questions for example hidden questions or formulas that help answer others
 Its best as it is i would recommend it to everyone
 The text of the Submit button cannot be changed sometimesTheres a limit of how many triggers can be activated by another triggerThe SEO embed functionality was recently removed
 Some Flexibility is lacking like simultaneous multi tablerecord updation etc
 The interface for building the datapage form is tiny It could easily be made to scale so the user could see more items without scrolling constantly This really needs to be fixed
 Havent found a problem yet But if there is a problem is maybe removing certain functions with minimal warning It would be nice to create better resolutions for users
 There are a few features Id like to see changed or made easier to useBut overall there isnt anything I dislike
 Whenever you need more complex functionality Caspio becomes far more complex and difficult to use than setting up a standalone SQL instance
 If you are used to coding the no code solutions can sometimes be cumbersome to figure out There are definitely times where I wish I could just write the SQL query or other code instead of using the GUI 
 The one thing I dislike the most about the software is that Caspio changed to a new version that offers triggers more space and bandwidth my account doesnt have them activated since Im grandfathered into an old plan to get the new features its literally twice the price I am being charged for overage on bandwidth and dont have access to the new features but spending twice the money for these new features is still not worth the price
 Wasnt able to creat a multiselect form with queries carried over into the next search Is not usable by a non developer Interface is clunky and looks outdated 
 We would request Caspio to be made more economical for developing and underdeveloped countries so that small and mediumsized enterprises can afford it as well
 The platform is inconsistent in implementation which slows the learning curve and frustrates development Professional presentation of results is often difficult to impossible without scripts and i cant write script
 Its quite difficult for new users but not all the functionality is difficult
 There are some simple tasks I would like to complete that just arent available options I think as Caspio continues to update their platform we will see more but sometimes it is limited if you have a something specific you are looking to deploy 
 There are some limitations like number of data pages and calculated fields However it does allow flexibility to add in your own code This really expands its limitations
 In some regards cost is a factorCaspio isnt inexpensive but you get what you pay forActually you get quite a bit moreWhen I look back on everything we have accomplished with Caspio it has more than paid for itself but its a consideration for smaller operations
 The full development if you need more customized app can be found in the forums No detailed manual on how to use the java script implementation
 Because it is not modelbased it may not be suitable for your business if you have complex business rules But other than that it will see you more than enough for all your needs 
 I do wish there were a couple of better data reporting options with more variations within the reporting optionsFor example Id like to be able to report the data on patients using different data pointsEgId like to look at the number of times my patients logged in then with a touch of a button see how many times these same patients watched a video
 There is a little bit of a learning curve with Caspio but its worth getting through Once you know the way that everything works its easy to get started on more complex applications
 If you havent built databases before it might be hard the first time Plenty of years of toying with stuff like this though and I had it up and running in a few hours 
 We hadvery limited technical expertise with any of the skills required to develop and integrate a product like Caspio with our simple requirements This is not a con but was certainly a concern once we decided to use Caspio This concern was quickly mitigated by the Caspio Team
 This is not a con per seThe caspio software has a lot of functionalityAs expected it takes a little time to understand how the platform functionsThe Support staff makes the learning process very easy 
 Control of the user interfaceand the lack of a header   detail or parent   child database structure and reporting 
 There was a learning curve There are very few cons The only con I would add is the issue where triggered actions are capped at 10000 records
 Sometimes I face some notification issues of task status but its not a major problem at all
 By its nature a no lowcode platform will have limitations There are solutions to overcome these limitations however they venture into the shallow end of coding
 Some triggered actions are limited by nesting which hinders the capabilities of Caspio
 When they do updates like everything else you need to figure it out for your specific needs
 Small learning curve when it came to programming advanced customizations but our use case was very specific so it was expected
 As I have used only Project Management feature of this tool I didnt have any issues But im sure their no any least of this tool 
 Knowledgebase could be bettercost for datapages can add up
 The biggest issue I face is working with mismatched data types I do find a roundabout way to solve the issue but if I can solve it then its definitely possible 
 When searching the online help center often produces too many resultsI think if you had a multilevel filterLike Datapages Reports Pivot Tables totals this might help narrow down the info
 In the beginning the software was a bit quirky and the speed sometimes was slow but these issues were ultimately resolved
 Occasionally having to use HTML codeCannot rename virtual and HTML fields
 Can be confusing to create apps and maintain data flow 
 I wish I could verify dataentry I have two series of fields which when totalled up should equal each other before the user can submit the changes to the record
 Few features missing but Im sure they are growing 
 Pricing is a little high 
 Customer support sometime transfer me fro one to another but still great support
 Getting used to the interface on how to build the programsThe one thing I would like to see improved is when building a datapage its very tedious to move datapage elements aroundI have pages with many elements and when I add a new one I have to click the up arrow a lot to move it aroundIt would be nice if I could click and drag it
 It is quite difficult to get use to the interface in the starting which frustrates the team members
 Offline functionality is a huge upsetIt is problem where we have considered moving to other platformsWhen we need to do condition assessment of field asset and we have no network connectivity we all end up frustrated with the platform regardless whether Caspio is to blameAn app environment would be a huge benefit 
 The learning curve can be a bit steep at first because some of my nonIT colleagues were not able to keep up with the training due to the advanced features The pricing can also be a hindrance to startup businesses
 It would be nice to have more some more control over time scheduled tasks but overall the solution is comprehensive and great to innovate new ideas within our business 
 There is a bit of a learning curve if you are unfamiliar with database software In the beginning I had trouble integrating it into my WordPress website and making it mobile compatible Customer service helped in both respects even though I use their free version of the software 
 Frankly its difficult for me to find anything about Caspio that I dont like The product is secure priced right and full of very cool features which Ive often relied upon It would only be better if Caspio actually clicked my mouse for me very expensive for what you get For  app we were at over $125 on a different platform we were able to create  apps for half the price
 Sometimes we would like Caspio to be quicker with the implementation of ideas that we give to the Staff
 Some of the features a latent and you really need to learn their application to maximize your efforts
 Could have more choices on export formats like exporting text files for an easier integration with other softwares
 Triggered actions arent included by default A light CMS integrated platform would be nice 
 It was a learning curve at first with Caspio but they have gotten so much better since I first learned how to use the system with new tutorials and videos posted monthly
 Customer service response should be faster An instructional video for training in operating the program should be provided at the beginning of the application
 If you give support me then i make best app They lock you into a year contract and you must send written notice to cancel 30 days before your contract expires or they lock you into another  year contract without your consentI know other customers have experience this so I will be looking into creating a class action lawsuit The price per month This is the most expensive of all of the low code database platforms Ive evaluated However the interface and functionality won me over Once I purchased a plan and began the build in earnest I was blown away by the level of support available 24  Ive had countless chats a zoom call and email tickets to get my database built Each member of the support team has been a wizard and so helpful Well worth the extra outlay
 It can begin to get a little expensive if you need to really scale up your program I would strongly recommend the product for small to medium size products 
 Caspio is lacking Scheduled Tasks so we had to use their API Set to set up some tasks external to Caspio
 For a nocode environment its actually not very user friendly To build something meaningful you would need expert assistance and you would need to purchase a plan before you can reach that stage 
 The pricing structure is Caspios least favorite feature It can be costly for users who need to access and update large amounts of data or who require more advanced features Furthermore for some users who are unfamiliar with database technologies there is a steep learning curve
 online data base and easy to manage all features 
 My Advice  No one deal with this deceiving company  they want me to pay for a whole year without any subscription  Bad Bad Bad Company 
 some of the videos are out of date
 At the beginning it is not so easy to understand but with the mastery otherwise no disadvantages as such 
 development features are spread across different areas makes it difficult to understand and adds development time
 Just a bit difficult when youre accessing the application for the first time as it has so many things Couldnt setup schedule task so we require some other tools to set it up
 I wish the custom app were more complex and sophisticated We prefer to have a better looking frontend for the user and basic functions such as downloading csv files and making the app mobilefriendly
 Would be great to see less words and more WYSIWYG style of interface perhaps even drag and drop to generate web fieldsOverall not a huge showstopper as there are learning tools and numerous YouTube videos to guide you
 I really have no complaintsIt has been a great tool so far
 Difficult at first but the team worked with me to help me understand software development 
 The filter function needs documentation
 It is not easy to find guides or resources that match my particular use case
 Help functions could have better search options
 Price difficult for smaller organizations to afford 
 Having so many features can feel very overwhelming when you first log in I wasnt sure where to start and put down the app for a month or so before I picked it up to learn it The Ultimate Video Guide series did help me understand the feature much better 
 and a little complicated to use lack more tutorials
 At the interface is not easy to master it make it more flexible 
 Eu não tem nada contra Esse e aplicativo
 Mobile applicationis very important  It will be add value
 Early on being nondevelopers sometimes it was difficult to imagine what we could do having little exposure We relied heavily on the ready made apps to understand and imagine the potential Then Caspio stepped in to help us customize
 We found that the complexity of your database and your needs for reporting has a bit of a learning curve so we could not go the DIY route and opted instead for a supported development process
 The software had some limited functionality when dealing with selection forms and would not easily allow to choose between prior data points or predetermined selection lists
 This is a challenging piece of software It is not easy to use but no more difficult than other DBMS 
 I wish it had more tutorials available for different applications
 At the moment Caspio fulfil all of our requirements
 I have not had any issues with using Caspio that I could not resolve
 I dont like a the option I have with caspio but Ive used worst before
 some of the feathers are not available Needs more colorful feather and navigation bar built in right now it doesnt allow link between tables and views
 The ability to upload documents securely would be a nice feature
 Styling is painful Like most lowcode options this tool is great if your use case matches their intended use but if you push beyond the designed intention it gets ugly fast
 they shut down our free platform and stopped my project dead in its track
 Complexity and misleading representation Lies and threats within trial period No
 When using the app for the first time it seems difficult to find what you really need
 Often it is difficult to embed it in your website and to make it compatible with mobiles
 unknown features at this moment   functionalities i did not discovered yet
 Some features are on costly tierConfusing subscription model
 Lack of flexibility and challenges with that as our company has grown
 user admin could be broadened with more roles
 The sales people there are horrible and dishonest Steep structural learning curve My experience with database systems began with DBase4 on DOS All of my previous databases were predicated on the idea that the record is not created until it is entered A Ninox record is entered when it is created Adding data to it is an update Here me know and believe me later there is massive power in this approach I was also concerned that my users would have problems understanding this none of them have ever noticed In this age of instant entry and notsaving they think it is normal
 Beginners who have not worked with database management systems before may experience some difficulties at first
 Too Mac centric iCloud as the sync option is ridiculous Struggles on server edition with medium sized data sets filtering becomes very slow You cannot actually do much with your data no real integration outside of Ninox Poor implementation of report design and printing which exposes too much to the end user Not enough separation between design and client use
 The English manual needs development I believe this is in hand there is so much information in the head of the support team that needs to get into the manual Layout needs improving I dont like having to messing about with spaces and line breaks I would prefer that we can place an object in position and it sticks in place
 There are certain simple things for example autoincrements for invoice numbers that require programmingstyle statements to set up
 I think the Design should be easier to Individualize using fonts and colors shapes and a wider Range of icons to choose from
 I would like to see the ability for better reports customization and more video tutorials
 It would be great if Ninox could provide with a good collection of predefined scripts
 To date we have not found any issues that we cannot solve in Ninox and so there is not anything that we do not like Pretty much in order of discomfort 1As you can see from other reviews the user documentation is lacking At some points it is missing and at other points it is just plain wrongTo mitigate this the user forum is a great resource and several Ninox partners have published use case driven guides 2As a 30+ year IT professional I had to adapt to the file based Ninox approach While you do create relations between table objects you have to rethink a bit of what you learnedOnce you get the hang of itYou are off to the races 3Even the local Mac App acts like the web Rows are committed on create then updated for each field update This just takes some getting used to On most of my applications I add buttons to save close the record so I can add data consistency logic in global functions as must as possibleThat logic is also repeated in data verification views so the user can scan for anomalies
 Having customer support in Germany is a bit of a pain and can make for long turnaround times and translation issues for problem resolution But fortunately the manual is fairly well laid out & explains most things in enough detail where some trial and error can get me to a workable solution
 The nocode feature is OK for simple customization But for more complex development coding skill is necessary 
 Just sorry we didnt find it years ago Also sorry we wasted time looking at alternatives
 It will be great if it would have a help section especially with video tutorials In the beginning is tricky to be sure that all the steps to build the desired app are done correctly
 A manual with code examples would be very helpful Customer service gets back with you very quickly when you have a problem 
 Some of the coding behind the scenes isnt as straightforward as VBA and some of the functions arent entirely intuitive but after ready some tutorials it becomes apparent
 User interface in the forms could be more attractive and functional CRM integration under development Tables relationships are not bidirectional
 Maybe a little better user interface More style to the look of the program Little better design controls in print view 
 you have to be careful when handling tables An accidental touch of the screen can make a column hide
 Creating large templates for input fields is difficult and manually entering data is slightly cumbersome
 The only con I have experienced so far It doesnt have the functionality to import images in a batch setup to match with records in the database where a field is reserved for an image
 That the world isnt flat and they are across the world But hey they do pretty darn well considering
 There are certain aspects that can be improved like the correct print layout on iOS devices the possibility to recover deleted data and the split screen option to check two tables at the same time
 Druckeditor hat AusbaupotenzialDas neue Preismodell ist für unsere Anforderungen nicht ganz ausgereift wodurch für komplexere Anwendungen individuelle Vereinbarungen notwendig sind Enterprise Private Cloud
 Als Entwickler wünschen wir uns Funktionen die unsere Entwicklungsarbeit vereinfachen Oft wird das aber erst entscheidend wenn man grössere komplexere Anwendungen mit Ninox entwickelt Wünschen würde ich mir auch ein inkrementelles Backup das entsprechend zurückgeschrieben werden könnte
 The grid system used to position fields in the forms you create can get really clumsy when a DB designed on an ipad or mac is viewed on an iphone The fields shift around and do not retain the positioning that they have on ipad or mac Unfortunately this is necessary as creating a miniaturized version of the ipad or mac form would result in fields too small to be easily used so this is a trade off I havent designed any of my DBs specifically for an iphone display so they all get a bit wonky when I use my iphone to view them First of all there are many new features all the time So I hope that the following points are already being worked on1 The export of PDFs leaves a lot to be desired Currently no subtables can be listed in tables font and cell formatting via HTML only works within tables but not in freely set text fields Multipage documents are difficult to create For example it is not possible to specify that an object should be placed on the next pageIn tables you can only group by one value It would be great if you could import eg rdlc files2 There are some feature differences from the Mac app to the cloud version Not only in obvious cloud functions like sending mail via sendgridEg there seems to be differences in the calculation order of loops3 Ninox uses its own language This seems to be based on other languages but not all functions or expressions work But here I am an absolute beginner and dont want to evaluate this I wish there were constant or global fields allowedAs a college teacher I import test results and the first page is usually the answers which I have to enter each result for the 25 questions and then Update Multiple Records and then Assign Constant Value but that is just a workaround fix as the results are simply added to each recordIf I have a student taking a late test a regular occurrence I have to then reenter the answers and assign constant value again because its not a global or constant fieldIf I am missing something let me knowBuilding calculations can be cumbersome with the many clicks across tabs to access the part you need once I figure it out the pattern though I do switch to the text interface and Im glad that thats thereWishful thinking I would love there to be a map interface I use this for data from archaeological sites and locationspecific data from interviews with indigenous elders and community membersCurrently I log UTM coordinates Northing Easting Elevation or Lat Long but I have to export those to see the distributionsA throw to a Google Maps screen or other interfaces would be quite neat and timesaving and useful for data analysisI imagine others would like to see something similar for mapping locations using customer address fields or showing all customers throughout the country or something
 The documentation could still be improved especially for beginners There should be more example videos what can be realized with Ninox because often the new users are surprised what can be realized with Ninox
 I really needed a long time to find something about ninox that is worth to criticize The start screen is not a beauty at all but thats the smallest amount you work with The most work to do is done in the single charts So what can I say what do I not likephewthe printing layout is a little bit elaborately to copy to other printing forms But ninox works already on this case Die Sprache ist noch nicht als allumfassende Anleitung hinterlegt Eine Suchanfragendatenbank mit typischen Fehlern Verknüpft mit euren Lösungen würde so manchen Sprechstunde vorwegnehmen schliefen und so ebenAufbau und design sowie Kalenderintegration sind auf Mac eingeschränkt Warum sind links im Titel Deskription versteckt und nicht als Linkfeld in Apple hinterlegt # Preise in iCloud völlig okay sogar sehr günstig Aber für eine Firma die Mit mehreren Usern darauf arbeiten möchte sind 1315 Euro je User und Monat zuviel Schaut euch mal die Preise von Miro microsoft an diese Preise sind wirklich interessant There arent really any Cons as such as to be honest Ive had a near perfect experience The only thing I would possible recommend is expanding the online documentation and reference to include useful or commonly used bits of code and formulas Its worth noting that they already do this as well as provide a number of templates for different kinds of databases but it would be cool if there was a bit more in the way of examples and snippets I use the program Max MSP by Cycling74 and their documentation of their code come as actual working patches which you can copy into your own patch as well as there being a vibrant online community with people sharing their own patches etc This way its quite easy to get something working by piecing bits and pieces together before learning the entire syntax Id love to see some sort of central repository for commonly used formulas and ideas such as this for Ninox
 Ein paar Wunschfunktionen fehlen noch wie ein internes Kommunikations Chatsystem Außerdem stellt der limitierte Speicherplatz oft ein Problem dar Die Funktion Löschen wenn wäre ebenfalls ein überaus nützliches Feature sowie die Möglichkeit Felder zu kopieren
 I would like to have more capacity to display information in the columns in the impressions area Better integration with the calendar and that you could see more information from the calendar and incorporate alerts such as icons and colors for example To be able to establish a timeline Improve document printing features For a first time user or someone that is not 100% computer literate it can be a bit difficult to grasp at firstSome of the terms used are odd but allinall its decent software
 The documentation leaves alot to be desired particularly their scripting language The tool is very simple to use and intuitive but when you get to a point where youre creating custom fields filters and rules you have to know the Ninox scripting language and thats where the documentation could use a little improvement Im not a programmer by trade and the documentation seems to assume that users are
 Could have better templates and more functionality on the UX of the user interface
 There is a bit of a learning curveNinox is not a traditional relational database management system
 Bulk data relationship between tablesFormulary view needs to improveUser friendly programing by drag and drop needs more options actually only accesible by code typingPrinting layout can be more sophisticated Trying to get to grips on how to integrate formulas I also wish there was more flexibility with the Calendar we have 90 odd consultants and when we put all of their project dates in its more or less unusable as a graphical representation of their busy and free periods
 Some features are missing but are in plans to be on the next version Those are quite cased specific features so you may not need them depending on your needsBut seeing how they take care of their product and clients Im sure their next version will amazing!!
 The only thing I could mention is that there are still functions which Id like it to have For example it would be great to be able to send attached pdf documents over email as in click a button and have the document attached to an email which is ready to be sent Hope they add this in the future 
 At the first glance Ninox is very easy to handle but doesnt give you a good impression ofthe possibilities to customizing and working out individual solutions by its programming language NX The interface is not the prettiest and can only be modified to a certain point I cant wait to see v3 because that is when software hits its stride
 Not easy to do create reports and you will need to create formula fields to do calculations
 The update took away the easy edit tool so I cant figure out how to change my database anymoreLuckily I dont think I need to make any major changes anymoreInitially it took a while to get used to but some of the updates have made it easier to navigate and get the information that I want in a report format that is easy to read
 None so far wish the reports were easier to use wish they could be broken down by week months or days not easy to customize on the PDF side however downloading the CSV is ok
 I like to have multiple databases open on the same time This is at this point only possible with the web version Developers told me its coming in one of the next releases
 So far the only cons I experience is missing the functionality to import images in a batch set up to match with records in the database where a field is reserved for an image
 The Ninox surface could be a bit more modern but according to Ninox this will be realized soon
 Ideally it would be good to be able to add Forms in order to create a landing page but I know this is in developmentBeyond that the ability to customise fonts colours etc is probably the next stage
 Probably an Italian language guide and or the possibility to partecipate at some class would be appreciate for me that do not know programming and db management
 Pure code editor should be improved less error messages and sometimes a Little Bit complicate Syntax for the indecies
 I did need a jump start on some minor issues but the helper company Ninoxus was extremely helpful 
 The inability to send invoices with a template message Color and font options for field names might add a better form like feel and appearance
 Not as easy to use for an aggrigate view like summarizing or averaging data from multiple data cellsNeeds to be exported or represented as a graph
 Adding colour to tabs would highlight these to users as they tend to look down along the left Adding a print button which automatically produces a pdf file For a developer if you have many users each using the same template you can make changes to all of the templates without going into each database and changing to program There is no scope or encouragement for a developers program where we could sell the package to our customers for a reasonable fee
 Learning how to use it can be complicated at first especially for those who have little experience with databases
 I would love an improved iOS version for th iphone but this is still a very small issue for me 
 Pricing limited customization capabilities
 It would be great to have some sort of release strategy for your own Ninoxbased database products So you ship a release to your colleagues clients and develop a new release without messing around with the live databases
 There is a little bit of a learning curve but it isnt very hard to learn Ninox its hard to reach the limit of 100 characters in this field But I can suggest everybody to contact support when you are thinking there is something not possible it often is possible
 Required a little more programming than expected
 UI is simple but the minimaliste is a good way for beginner and pro
 The Limited UI support as in how the UI looks and works when editingCode wont work in real time as in wait loops and such
 Need more tutorials this is not a con This would just be very helpful as there are so many amazing features that we dont know about
 Documentation is insufficent have to search for required information   no manual    no Windows app available would be nice but not necessary as there is web access
 Ninox hat es meiner Meinung nach noch schwer mit dem Thema UI Wenn da in die Richtung mehr kommen würde mich das sehr freuen
 The support part has ample room for improvement sometimes it is not immediately easy to retrieve the information needed to solve certain operations
 the manual must be searchable on the ninox homepage I wish Ninox had more documentation but thats been improving steadily over the  months Ive been using it
 Functionality description is not complete You do not have information about all the feature and functions
 De NX language is complex in use I am an experienced VBA programmer but in Ninox I have many problems
 I would like to have a designer to allow more easy configuration of colors styles and more in the table view Also the reportengine is not as sophisticated as in Filemaker But overall it seems more easy to learn is much better supported and also cheaper
 If you really have to nitpick there are two things that could be better One is filters there is no way to filter or order the table view by column A then column B at the moment or to filter a multiple choice column with choice A AND choice B or by choice A OR choice B The second is maybe an ability to remove all nonvisible fields when printing a record as currently the capacity for adapting the print layout is fairly limited
 Interface could be improved and the cloud edition dont sync dates with Apple calendar Moreover for some kind of records miss an empty records filter
 Still waiting for security on iPad so I can set permissions for other users of the same data hide sensitive data and prevent edit deletions 
 A few functions did require a little programing but customer support helped me through itNinox Customer Support was there whenever we needed assistance and was able to quickly resolve our requests
 I would like the user interface to be more customizable if anything
 The user manual and documentation gloss over a number of important features etcSwitch is an example How is it best optimised as I am finding long processing times hours
 Dindt find many cons The manual could be a bit better but it think they are working on that And they sad the connection with mail chimp will be there soon so then they have solved that for me When you save  lay out for print i cannot use it for other databases It is better that you can save own templates
 When I made a duplicate database renamed it made it empty I discovered that the original DB was also empty And what is more all daily archived copies before the date of duplicating were also empty In other words one year of work is lost
 forse dovrebbe costare un pò meno per poter raggiungere un maggior numero di clienti
 It is too easy to accidentally delete a whole database
 Limited reporting capabilities The app would benefit from better graphs and reporting functionalities
 Exporting comes across with spaces and other charachter having multiple characters I have to massage and clean up export data before being usable I would like a form field view where I could make different types of forms in the platform itself Do not take away the simplicity of the existing for fields but if I wanted to design a letter per say in another area that would be awesome 
 We would like to have more features more choice of fields adding graphics etc
 The user manual needs to be more comprehensiveProgramming in Ninox is at times difficult but the expert online support staffhas been an excel source of helpThey are very responsive and their screen sharing sessions have been most valuable
 Graphic design capability Possibility to have multiple databases open at the same time More tutorial videos
 Sometimes the program is a bit slow when opening it in a browser otherwise the applications work well In some complicated cases it takes time to understand the logic behind the formulas but it is more personal problem not software related
 I dont like that the software doesnt allow much flexibility with visual design colors and such A background would be nice and the ability to adjust the design visuals 
 Does not have the full data manipulation capabilities of SQL or MS Access There are very few bugs none of which will damage your data but there are a few to be aware of regarding date input and parameters and percentage math
 That there are so many things I do not know by now
 I wish it had a way to see all map data on one mapFor my sales job this is important 
 It annoys me the most that I can not program that I do not speak any programming language and thus can not exploit the full potential of NInox
 At the moment the manuals are poor because they assume quite advanced knowledge of the Ninox script language which I and many others struggle to understand So the help desk gets inundated with a lot of really basic questions that could be answered if they just had a Ninox Script for Beginners document covering the really basic things
 Its impossible for me to make séveralmodels of quotes invoces If I have to put different legal informations on each one I have to do it at the end before printing for example by removing some of them
 In punkto Nichtgefallen haben wir nichts gefunden bisher
 ease to delete work youve just done when you start
 It should look good and beauty menu and icons
 Support team only works on Central European Time CET so if you are in the United States and having issues getting assistance can be delayed and a littleirritating
 If you need to do something a little more complex you will need to code a little but this does not detract from the overall product at allsupport is very responsive and they even write the code for you if you need it
 Poor documentation   help need more examples more examples related to specific functionsDespite no need to know coding would like to learn so need more examples of how each function works
 The only thing that I would like to added is more skin customization but that is a minor nit picky thing on my part
 I would like if you could select more items and be able to copy and paste items inside the setup menus of a database
 No drawbacks but a better possibility of customizing the interface would be welcome
 The manuals arent sufficiently developed for a relatively competent computer user to work out solutions alone That said the customer support is so good that you scarcely need the manual
 A little difficult to learn from scratch particularly how to link tables togetherHence my need to contact Ninox support
 Huge and increasing number of features customisable to the extreme needs a bit of time investment to get to the bottom of some features but worth it in the end
 A little weak on mobilephones sometimes hard to find the documentation for the programming language
 If youre entirely brand new to using databases then you might need some help to produce reports but the customer service is absolutely brilliant
 need more knowledge to develop complex applications
 A bit tricky to set up and theres a lack of video tutorials and guides but the support is great
 Probably a higher number of tutorials will help the newbies like me faster especially about the formulas language
 I honestly couldnt fault anything at all 
 I honestly have no negative concerns so far and I hope I run into none as I keep using this tool 
 Sometimes its not so easy to train the user for using the application Maybe little bit old style
 After syncing fine for several days it now is refusing to sync any changes to the cloud The tech support while helpful is often two or three days in coming That makes for a long time sometimes to resolve an issue Lastly it is missing an easy picklist field type where another table can be used as the source for fields in other tables
 not much the coding is a little difficult but we have tech support help that allows that to be far easier 
 Still needs some features
 Editing sheets before generate pdf and printing 
 Its not so easy to figure out what you have to do at first Its fine once you get the hang of it but there could be a more detailed onboarding so its easier to get things started
 I actually think they can improve on the support and community areas I was not able to connect to more clients using Jestor to exchange knowledge or hire talents 
 You guys should communicate the changes that you are planning and implementing Several times I had to do re work because of changes that happen and I was no aware that they would happen 
 Jestors pricing model is moderately confusing with what does and doesnt count as an action 
 There are a few bugs that can make the job a little frustating
 I still cant get a hang around the concept of action per monthAs someone who develop enterprise software for enterprise use having this count of action seems to be pulling you back from what you want to achieveFurthermore the pricing is not easy to understandPersonally I prefer something more predictable
 Some automation needs coding and depends on Jestor teams to do it for us 
 I could not use the app for Windows it doesnt work well it not even open In this way I could not se any notification about the tasks I had to complete so it takes a more attention to have all sync and done But as I use Jestor daily it is not that bad 
 Documentation could be improved in order to make take up easierCreate certifications
 The fact that it lacked many of the functionality that was available in competing applications Nevertheless they have been adding a number of features and integration I was used to Notion Airtable and ClickUp and Jestor just seemed insufficient when comparing to those options Of course it is a much younger startup but still My role is not to be an early adopter of tech but rather deliver solutions to my orgs problems and Jestor wasnt the ideal application when trying to build some of our systems at the time I tried it about  months ago We then decided to hire ClickUp as the selected provider
 Senti falta de algumas integrações nativas com ferramentas como Asana e Google Forms
 at the report feature could add a kind of select of drag and drop tables fields the main point is kind of create report based on MER of company using all connections that its has  PK FK etc
 Senti falta de um melhor onboarding e template completo para iniciar a utilização
 That are a few important features that are still missing Ive asked for them for the supportThe more I use it the more Ill find other missing features however its the agility of the Jestors team that can make a difference by implementing everything the clients asks It would be amazing if it could integrate with Asana
 A little bit laggy sometimes but they are improving the performance
 It is difficult to use Jestor in all of our use cases here at Caju So I tried to implement in some areas but the people who are running the processes wasnt prepared to drop their usual tool like CRM or Ticket manager to start with Jestor Overall I think its just too expensive to be use it It sure does have benefits but its not worth it We will preferably deal with  or  different apps to manage everything than pay 1000 a month
 Cannot connect to PowerBI and cannot Copy and Paste cells from Excel
 Cant think of anything it is a great product so far
 O app poderia ser melhor otimizado além do mais chega a travar muitas vezes 
 Requiring login with a google account was a show stopper for us
 In the same way that the platform is no code there are some features that require a certain notion of programming which is not userfriendly in some points
 Not much some of the processes are new so took time to learn
 The plugins or integrations is in its early stages in terms of number 
 I wish there were more connections hope the team would add them soon
 I felt that for the nocode propose it should be more available nocode functions and features If we really want to use Jestor to avoid conventional services such as Excel with the premise of no coding needed Jestor need to implement more functions to deal with our data Such as date manipulation
 First process to create tables and apps its necessary support of the Jestors team to be made it quickly
 I find it confusing to start moving for the first time without help
 Hard to integrate with external databases such as PostgreSQL
 There could be more prebuilt templates
 Not the best solution for end customer more focused on backoffice solutions
 The platform could have more features integrations and could be used for more applications like Airtable Notion and others
 We can expand for more options of integrations how nosql db
 It takes time to set up everything and use the full power of the platform doesnt have easy templates you can just plugandplay
 More training documents maybe useful Videos on how to create processes also will be helpful
 platform do not have user manual and chat software is missing on platform
 Bugs glitches no more than is typical
 Company can make video tutorials which would make easier to understand features Software usually comes up with updates which is good but can be confusing at times UI can be improved for Dashboards and Apps2 Dashboards configuration can be more agile
 Ease of use the tool has some constraints for example one touch is always required to move to next stepVisually the tool is not appealing Consumers feel selecting an option or typing from drops downs time consuming compared to other appsespecially when list is largeautomated bots takes time based on size of backend data number of tablesshould enhance speed
 Little bit UI improvements could be done
 Though it has an impressive range oftools to support our online markets growth we feel the interface features can be improved further more 
 It takes a while to get the required customization 
 Technical support team should be available on calls as well Having to raise ticket is a timeconsuming activity Though they respond quickly however Id appreciate a quick call to resolve issues
 Just like any other software it also requires tech support to be improved However you get a quick response from support team once you raise the ticket for the same
 User experience Design could be better I wish things could be combined into  sheet
 I feel that it could be made a bit more easier to user
 Can be overwhelming for new users Takes time to discover features
 It would be nice if the frontend interface could be more highly customized
 You should market it to known companies first Rest of small scales will follow organically
 Training and a working understanding of fundamental programming are required for software customization A minor inconvenience and time sink is the trouble shooting option which occasionally fails to identify the issue Our company adheres to TNI 2016 and ISO 17025 it would be nice if the software had a Management Review app
 We are an onpremise installation with Windows server and Mac clients Some of our regulations required changes that were unique to our installation Working through the installation took significantly longer than advertised However once installed Intellect does deliver on the advertised functionality
 Much of the OOB workflows and configurations are not reflective to typical QMS workflows for the pharma med device industry therefore heavy user configuration is required The documentationpackage is not compliant execution and the documentation effort was poorURS FRS Guides are not even accurate much less complete Understanding how the OOB configurations work is key to efficient user configurations The documentation package should be a reliable source for that understanding but it is not While my technical support person has been excellent the number of hours required to configure the OOB FAR exceeds the actual number of hours granted as part of the purchase Not just wish list configuration or company specific configuration but configuration to mirror industry expectations for work flow and compliance
 Although the systems initial cost is much lower than most the user licensing and support fees can quickly increase especially for smaller organizations and if you need to open the system to all employees for training and access to SOPs etcI would have liked to have had indepth System Administrator training If you have only one or two people configuring and managing the system you will likely need professional support services at an additional cost as we did The Intellect team is very flexible and accommodating to our unique needs and was able to scale the pricing and licensing options to meet our budget The outofthebox QMS applications are geared toward manufacturing but they are customizable
 Understanding the logic behind the system macros was a little hard in the beginning
 Understanding the logic initially was a challenge
 In our experience this software was very useful and effective but also very expensive compared to other software we trialed
 El precio puede ser alto en comparación con otras herramientas de gestión de calidad en línea Su implementación puede ser complejas para algunos usuarios nuevos Algunas características avanzadas como la integración de datos de terceros están disponibles solo en planes de precios más altos
 We found sometimes it is a challenge to use keywords to search document archives Intellect Workflow software could be better in this areaThe types of charts though extremely useful are also limited in category and in typeStarting a month in subscription fees Workflow Intellect is not the most cost effective solution unless user interaction is consistent and the associated use case requires this level of management
 On the rare occasion you do run into an issue the troubleshooting tools available may not clearly define the problem and you may need to request support
 Onboarding takes some time due to adding customizationsOnboarding would have been quicker if we used the out of box features but the extra set up time was worth the benefit of having a fully customized system in the end
 We have had to use a double review process in order to be sure that all changes are captured before a document is approved
 The mobile app needs improving Looks like it is left on its own and it needs some modifications Sometimes doesnt work properly on Android and IOS devices Needs support here
 Initial training should be separated into an Overview End User training for key stakeholders and then training for Designers and AdministratorsSince this is geared to nonprogrammers in our case the importance of process design and planning documentation system administration etc should also be included with the actual creating applications training
 Almost impossible to use out of the boxThe marketing team is great and I believe the software can do all of the great things but only with configurationYou really dont know what you need until you become very familiar with the softwareThe upfront training needs work for the customer to get a better feel of their needsThis would have made white glove more effective and efficient This software does not offer a design and development appValidation of any configuration is not supported well
 Some out of box screen prompts can be improved for a more enhanced experience We didnt like having to change our document numbering system starts at  however we were able to provide metadata that made it easy for longterm users to find their documents using their initial numbers
 Theres a Help tab by default on each App but its just a placeholder that needs to have something generated by the customer Would be nice if this could be hidden off the bat and only enabled once something is uploaded but this is really splitting hairs Its super good Customer service is poor to follow up on reported issues Required backup on every instance of a help desk ticket backups only done through company our IT As a designer changes to a single template item on average takes 30 seconds to a minute to process which can be cumbersome when making alot of changes When a error is generated there should be a simple one click option that imports all of the relevant error information to a email or help desk form instead of forcing the user to go through the cumbersome process
 When configuring there has been times where as a Designer I can save and have everything function correctly only to find out during a publish that an error occurs This causes a delay in publish and impacts client perceptions on build time 
 We have had a very positive expereince with Intellect
 I dont like how Microsoft when interacting with Intellect To open a document to make changes you need to double click on link click open click enable editing then enable content It is slow and lots of clicks just to be able to open a document to make edits
 I have found that app development can occasionally be a pain to get done properly but this is due to how much stuff is interconnected 
 The software occasionally throws a curve ball but Intellect Customer Support will work through the issues with youI would like to see more helpful and readily available published app training documentation to reduce reliance on customer support
 For someone who does not have programming skills it can be quite annoying configuring some items every single time in different templates and different parts of the workflow such as email notifications A tool such as copy and paste would be wonderfull
 Just waiting for Intellect to complete their ISO certifications which they are in process of 
 We do need assistance from customer service when weve tried to set up some functions and for those considering the platform its probably a good idea to budget some addon hours if you are not particularly tech savvy Once the system functions are in place its very intuitive I dont think any platform is turnkey and some have real limitations Intellect has the capacity to do everything we need
 Everything is a rabbit hole with troubleshooting and it is very time consuming even with support from Intellect Audit trail feature is poor at best 
 Intellect QMS has some good features but there are some drawbacks One issue I faced was with the mobile apps offline capabilities Another was that the software was not very configurable which made it harder to customize it Technical support was also very helpful in resolving these problems
 So far we have yet to find something we dont like about Intellect 
 Wish we could develop more applications not a negative for Intellect but for my company
 Much longer lead time to go Live with than originally told when they sold the software More customization is required than originally thought and takes up half the time work of a full time employee Did not anticipate a team member to be so dedicated the software and expected more setup for the cost
 The calibration app out of the box could use some improvement for reporting purposes
 It can be a little tricky to get the workflows working correctly if you make changes The software is designed for a larger company that we are so some of the apps needed to be made less complex to suit our needs
 We had a bug before going live but Intellect fixed quickly 
 The publishing process can be a bit tricky
 Occasionally I have seen some fields get corrupted
 Does not come with actual esignature like DocuSign
 Intellect requires a lot of bandwidth to complete the publishing of sites to the test and live sites Difficult to do during normal business hours on slower networks
 The only thing I would want to see in the future from Intellect is a way to adjust the layout of the personal navigation menu Other than that the application is great
 The out of the box applications did not suit my needs from the medical device industry
 It would be nice if there was a richer report designer for the creation of professional looking printouts   pdfs
 As with any software it has limitations and specific interface requirementsSome of the interface requirements are a little cumbersome
 Seemingly archaic could be better softwares available
 I think that the Auto Documentation Report is a burden A more user friendly field mapping report or chart depicting the relationship of fields to apps templates and workflows would be helpful
 Does not work with some browsersLimitations on exactly what you can customizeNo onpremise versions
 Limited in field or data manipulation ie substring formatting and converting from text to number or concatenation Needs more programming procedural capability Option to manipulate a more complex SQL stmt Better charting capability
 Integration with external data sources could be more robust
 It is not as user friendly as other eQMS software solutions that I have used beforeThere are some items that you have to configure each and every time instead of making them system items that can be configured easier system fields email notifications etc
 Unfortunately we lost our lead support for the software and no it falls on me to continue which I have yet to do I do not know where to start But we have an investment that must bear to fruition and I am hoping that this week I will be able to seamlessly continue where the former left out What i like least that it was more difficult than i thought to just pick up where was left
 Onboarding process some time is slow Also mobile app need improvement
 The document storage aspect of the solution could be more dynamic Not enough keyword retrieval customization available
 very little to none prebuilt forms or templates that could be slightly modified to fit your needseverything needs to be built from scratch It would be nice if they offered a limited amount of free customer support after the initial set upIt would be nice to have something like  to  hours of free support every month
 It was set up geared towards GMP industry specifically manufacturing which makes configuration more intense for other industry use 
 Overall experience of the platform is good as of the moment
 Initial setup and configuration may require some technical expertise and can be timeconsuming
 My opinion was that the Integration process of the Software with our Organization did not go as smoothly as it could have
 I have very limited use of the productWe have yet to launch things here and i am scheduled to attend a training session at the end of august on the product
 For only a few of the features it was not extremely intuitive to navigate to the needed screen 
 The built in data dashboards and analytics are adequate but not amazing However these can be bypassed by exporting data to another platform using the integrations or API and custom dashboards and reporting can be built there
 Although Forms On Fire offers a comprehensive set of features it may be too complex for some users The user interface can be a bit intimidating for those who are unfamiliar with webbased applications Additionally the cost of the premium version may be too steep for smaller businesses or individuals
 It would be nice if the backend was more customizable 
 There are frequent problems whenever we try to make an update things dont seem to work how we expected them to Also the documents this platform generates seem to be missing items and we cant figure out how to fix this
 I think the website interface could use a few minor improvements like having data view columns maintain their positions between sessions or refreshes and perhaps a little more development on the dashboard although well probably develop our own that most of the vendors for this type of software simply dont offer
 The learning curve at the start is decent It took a few days of trial error and exploring to unlock the full potential and abilities of what it can do As it is fully customizable its not an out of the box solution but thats truly a good thing You make up for the initial learning effort by what you can eventually do with it Spend the time get to know it and it will alter your operation in every way
 Sometimes the customer support doesnt know what I am talking about when building the formsBuilding the forms is sometimes very confusing and very tedious The amount of time it takes to build a form sometimes is not worth the effort over using excel Not being able to force sync from the home page of the app is a downfall 
 The mobile design patterns are useful and utilitarian but they are somewhat limited and not customizable This is the not the product to use if you want to highly customize the UI This may be the case with most no low code mobile app platforms as I do not have familiarity with many others
 In depth training opportunities would be helpful
 It does a whole lot more than we need so it would be good to be able to use a simpler cutdown version
 Forms on Fire can be incredibly complex requiring users to do a lot of learning
 The form builder is a bit tricky to learn If your needs are basics features its quite simple but since you get in more complex forms then youd probably need their help to get it work properly
 Excellent initial product but needed modified to fit my job
 More design customizations and remote user management would make a great addition to the features set of FoF
 There is a learning curve on creating the formsWhen there is an error in your form it is not always easy to trace backI also think that the program is the most glitchy when I am creating a large form
 At this time I cannot think of any features that need improvement
 I only wish I was able to spend the time learn how to do more of the programming myself Data Entries Table View is cumbersomeId like to be able to sort the columns by relevance so I can see at a glancethe info I needOr it would be helpful if I could freeze pane so I can keep the left column stable while scrolling through the next 20 columns
 Support is mostly centred around US timezones we are Australian
 Difficult to get started The help emails are designed for computer geeks They assume that lay people understand the terms used
 You have to force sync to have it working sometimes
 When there are technical difficulties its really hard to get in touch with support 
 Programming is not that easy hard to learn
 They have a knowledge base that is great for getting started but often doesnt show enough examples for me to quickly understand how to make their more advanced features work And sometimes they go ahead and release new features yay without fully debugging or writing up how to use or the bugs theyve already found and are working on
 We got stuck with a few elements how to pass data in a certain format that didnt work but Forms on fire customer support were available to help us get through it It turns out it was user error and not Forms on Fire The interface to make your own forms isnt 100% intuitive though the amount of time needed to learn is very short and you can be up and running in less than an hour Subsequent customization of forms is really easy
 I was able to get started without contacting them for any help But more tutorials are always welcome
 Some features are still being worked on at times can become unstable and crash on us in the field Fortunately the entered data is being saved and we loose little time until we are back up and running While luckily not the largest issue for us the fact that there is a limit of 50000 row in the data sources does mean that there can be a risk regarding large scale operations but there do seem to be some work around that we are exploring for our larger systems
 The mapping feature using GPS function still needs improvement
 Not much to dislike Its a bit tough to get your head around some of the datasource read write functionsbut again their customerservice makes up for it whenever you encounter an issue 
 Data not always the way you want for presentation
 In ability to delete a form in the field if you needed to
 Forms on Fire has a very extensive knowledge base that could be improved by the addition of some short videos that walk users through some of the more complicated tasksThe support information is all there I just learn easier when I can see it in action
 Because the customization is so complete it does take a little while to learn how to use it to its fullest The learning curve is short though and once you make the investment of a couple of hours youll be enamored with the abilities 
 While there were some drawbacks to Forms On Fire such as the fact that it is more expensive than some other options on the market I found that the benefits far outweighed the drawbacks
 I had a hard time with the connectors and the templates but it is super easy after being walked through the process
 As being a customer in Germany german language would be a great thing to have
 Occasional redundancy of data inputs
 I would like to see more flexibility with the logo design specifically I could not enlarge the logo I would also like to see a mission or vision field that can be incorporated with the logo design 
 The only con is that I am not allowed to use all the awesome features available with this product
 Look of the menus etc could be updated to be a little more modern looking but its not a big deal Also more data sorting options can be added Programming process is ridiculously hard Once you get a degree in computer programming things might run smootherBut if you have to make a change  months laterGo back to school because you would have forgotten all the coding
 We should be able to select multiple data Forms when exporting data in Table View 
 its difficult to build the back end of the form Especially if I want to add in some more in depth logic  
 Right now I cant enter a picture after it has been placed in the desktop I would like that ability
 Very occasionally we have a report that is lost in space but its the info is recoverable from the FoF website
 Sometimes I have to force sync to get what I want to pull up but nothing too hard to do
 Competitors have put more time into the reporting capabilities front end ability to view slice data as well as form calculation formula
 While Formsonfire offers a range of pricing plans that are designed to be accessible to businesses of all sizes the cost can add up quickly if you require a large number of forms or advanced featuresAnother potential issue with Formsonfire is its limited offline functionality While the platform does allow users to collect data offline there are some limitations to what can be done without an internet connection This may be a concern for businesses that operate in areas with limited connectivity or require realtime data collection and reporting
 I used the app for my mobile which is overall good app and gets the job done also However it did clamp on me at one point but Im not sure if it was my network on my end or the app This was not a big deal because it did pick back up Which goes to say I that my least issue was not that much of a issue
 No sure I just test it on a trial version and still on evaluation 
 Tough question but perhaps the lack of the ability to connect directly to an SQL database without the API or publish fields directly to SharePoint
 Compared to other migration projects I really cannot answer this question at this time We literally built tested and had users operational in week and that was with the education time The instructor in this case was [SENSITIVE CONTENT] and he seems to have the right combination to coach train developers like me that have just been introduced to the tool prior to the project development 
 The inability to change the structure of the software once we went too far down the development path
 There is not freemium model and the pricing seems to highThe knowledge base provides tutorial for the basic level of data But we need to figure out on out own for more advanced featuresLots of bugs in the features
 The software has amazing capabilities but there doesnt seem to be a complete tutorial to guide you through a lot of the stuff I cant do There are a number of basic video tutorials available but if you want to do anything beyond the most basic there is a fairly steep learning curve
 The software does not really support repeating tables within repeating pages Hopefully this can be corrected with time I believe this would be a very strong feature
 Some solutions could only be accomplished by feeding data through Google sheets but the compatibility with these outside integrations has been fantastic
 An easier solution for repeating tables or tables with info from data sources would be nice
 They are pieces of the software that I havent yet review But so far I would say the dashboard could improve
 Maybe just visual when you are working in the app with the fields
 Some of the categories dont have all the features needed For example the tech sales form doesnt have the ability to choose specific options from a technicians available servicesNot having cell service at all locations could have an offline version
 Uploads at times need to sync if not watching close forget to do this
 Implementing some more advanced functionality can require quite a few steps to accomplish the desired outcome I have no poor issues to report on FOF It is much better then A3 that I had with a previous company
 After the report is generated I would like the ability to send it back to the software for edits 
 Very very poor design and way too much information Im really not a tech guy and Ive seen a lot of good reviews so sorry for this bad one but this couldve been super usefull for me and Icant use it because I do not understand anythinig that is going on I cant put on photos on the app for instance
 A few things are not as intuitive as I might like but the great support overcame that I was looking for a feature to display two columns on the form and they are working on that
 It needs to have a bigger area for signatures 
 The layout was overwhelming to look at I think there could be a more organized way and a more sleek layout for the software
 We have yet to use this for all of sales Map updates would be great
 Personally I found this software very confusing The layout was overwhelming to look at I think there could be a more organized way and a more sleek layout for the software
 Ive noticed so lagging when going through quickly
 The constant emails I get from support are annoying I also wish that some of the desktop features were available on the app
 Parfois trop doptions et un peu complexe à utiliserLe cout du premium peut être rédhibitoire 
 Sometimes its hard to edit the forms when you have a lot of pages
 Difficult user interface
 I wish there was a comment section where I could explain a deviation that wasnt listed on the original form 
 The prices is the only thing I like the least is a bit to high compare to other similar options 
 I didnt experience anything while using FOF that gave me reason to pause
 application interactions was able to make my own templates because of need
 Need a free version and also a lot of emailing from communication team Also need some more features in the desktop version
 Definitely a learning curve to get it useful
 Some times customer service is lagging Nonetheless most of the issues are solvable using the knowledge base and FAQs section
 I havent had any issues with the app It works for my use
 Some of the visual aspects could improve to look more professional Both Forms on Fire and what you create in it
 I think the whitelabel cost could be lower Its a little bit complicated to understand the connection between the parts
 Like any system it is important to remember that in order to achieve its optimal understanding and development it is necessary to enter and relate directly and personally to the application which is why users should be aware of their needs so that later can try different solutions for your needs Remember that although there are free versions also the paid versions offer a wider range of possibilities and developments
 Pricepoint and bugs Knowing the number of variables AppSheet has to account for in any app there are still certain kinks that need to be worked out Also AppSheet is free unless you really want to utilize all of its features Unfortunately once you start getting into apps that require multiple users or creating workflows then you start paying per user or a tier based price structure per app With competition quickly rising their prices are easily beat by competitors like PowerApps 
 Only issue I have is with selling the products The approach and methodology have never been clear There should be examples shown or cheat sheets explained so you know what costs you can allow when selling the product It would also be great to display linear assets on the maps rather than use just a little coloured coded pointer to the assets My App runs on prestored data and once my users have selected the questions a code was presented and no matter how hard I tried I couldnt get this code to just populate its field The code had to be selected otherwise it did not save I still dont know how to get  of my codes to save without being clicked
 the amount of money the students has to pay if they want to use it for comercial purpose glideapp is free but limited
 It is too expensive for me It costs about the same as all of Google Workspace 
 AppSheets performance may vary depending on the complexity and size of the application and optimizing performance in such cases can require additional effort and finetuning
 Suggested that AppSheet could benefit from additional customization options expanded template libraries and improved reporting and analytics capabilities The platform may have a learning curve for those with limited app development or data modeling experience Integration with existing business processes can be challenging particularly with complex or highly customized systems However AppSheet offers various integration options and resources to assist users in overcoming these challenges
 first contact not easy Even with the models hard to improve a new workflow or rule
 Most of the time the template from AppSheets will not be entirely useful to your needs so be aware that often you will need to customize the product Thus what I like least is the small sample of templates available for starters
 The synchronization point appears to be an issue and the identification of calculations and their operations particularly those that differ from Google Sheets formulas could need a little more detail It would be wonderful to have a simple way to manage the play ground environment
 If you use the free version there is a very long loading time required If you use the paid version it might be worth your time to look into software that is customized to your business needs already You may find something for slightly more that will work well You will be using Google Sheets for all your data and information If you are uncomfortable with a spreadsheet this may not be the best for you 
 There are limitations that are quite possible for a platform that is still evolving
 If you are not in the programming world some of the functions are a little more complicated to use and take some trial and error 
 Well to really have the best of the appsheet software you have to pay for their subscription plan but if its just for pesonal use you can still use it for free 
 I think its a little spendy since you have to have a payment plan for each app you want to deploy You could design a simple website and have it hosted for cheaper 
 this app needs support for microsoft infopath forms and microsoft access and visio drawings databases inport
 Its a little slow its takes more time than usual to update changes to the cloud dont know why Im sure it will get better with time
 Sometimes when new features are introduced bugs and errors are also introduced Vigilance is needed to mitigate such scenarios
 It did however seem to lack flavor when it came to customizingCan be a bit slow at time and has problems loading a few times
 Appsheet is missing payment gateway integrationThere are some alternative addon methods to overcome but a native payment integration would be lovely
 I least liked that the chain of command for support is not direct I had an instance where I wasnt getting a reply and had sent three emails but noone new from support would help me because the first guy was handling it This was timeconsuming and inefficient and made me feel as though the whole support team rested on one person The integration with Airtable is still in its very early stages so if all your data is in Airtable I would recommend moving to Google Sheets if your heart is set on Appsheet
 Some more design customisation would be great Appsheet has allowed me to replace my highcost crm with a lowercost solution but it doesnt look as nice It would also be useful for there to be more of a streamlined navigation with databases and storage in Google Cloud Platform given they are both google A freetier or low cost SQL database would be a great addition to the product 
 As per my observations the platform is supported in many languagesThis is already a barrier for other countries that are not of the English language world to cope with itI believe the world would be better or still best if digital evolution is spread all around it
 UX Web view It would be great if the look of Web browser view is improvedIt would be much easier faster for new creators to Learn if there are some sample apps that run in full functionalities and integrate with InAppTutorialLess focus on developing financial apps although there are some mini budgeting app Being a webbased platform this one feels clumsy to use when developing There is always a persistent lag that is detectable They have made great strides in this area but still fall short of a true software  Google Appsheets UI Design does not offer a lot of flexibility and is most helpful when creating business cycle apps Nevertheless you can undoubtedly create simple apps of any kind The point is that it is not highly adaptable and you will probably encounter problems that prevent you from creating an app because of platform restrictions  When compared to apps made with programming languages this app performs decently This app will be useful if youre making a simple app
 Limited in terms of UI UX which makes it look clunky and boring when displayed to the user The capacity of application users is also not clear thus giving limitations to application makers to use AppSheet for large projects or not
 I didnt like that I couldnt set up a user sign up set up independent of the third party options available for signing up via google etc The Application is a lowcode platform with high level syntax This makes the application slow to use If the application complexity increases the time it takes to finish certain task increases nonlinearly2 appsheet provides limited customization which means there is a chance you will run into problems that are just unsolvable with this program3 Since this is a web based application This UI feels a bit less responsive
 I will say AppSheet takes a bit of time to get through the learning curve Brand new users might experience some frustration But after the initial learning period AppSheet definitely becomes easy 
 Because we work with apps in both English and Arabic its important that we be able to switch between the languages or even use both in certain fields The support for lefttoright and righttoleft languages could be improved We understand this is a pretty narrow use case but it would allow greater adoption in the refugee space
 Activating the app on users phones can be somewhat annoyingUnless you go to the higher paid tier you can only use Google accounts to access the app
 Some column types arent useful in certain situations The worst part of AppSheet in our experience however has been the need to recreate custom formatting for each column in a table Since this table has hundreds of columns we really wish we could copy and past or duplicate styling 
 Modest flexibility of the layout and design options
 The workflows and automations can be a bit tricky to get set upCreating user limitations has not been super easy and Id like to see user profiles that set permissions for different user groups
 Sometimes it takes a long to synchronize The way to correct mistakes that you make is not always obvious and you will need help But on the other hand the community is large enough and very helpful so you will never have these problems for a longer period
 As mentioned before the limited customization options Also applications can run slowly if the user is using a not so powerful device
 We cant save the communication at our desired location or folder like we can save the emails 
 Although AppSheet offers a lot of tools and ways to develop an app we can find a development limitation and problems that would not be the case if the development were done with code
 Only EnglishWould need more options for users management and invites for learner onboarding
 Not much training videos or guides avaliable Outdated training materials online
 Navigation sometimes confusing but getting better with updates maybe some more options for the background and start up screens etc but thats a minor issue
 Performance to be increased
 Not knowing everything about it yet There is no code to learn as such but a lot of functionalityOnce you learn how expressions work you can exert a lot of control over the user experience and control data entry and am only just starting to do this
 The sync time seems to be a bit of an issue also definition of formulas and their functions could use a little more detail especially those that differ from Google Sheets formulas
 Does not have option to share leads with individual app usersNot very easy to create help videos were old 
 Many users ask me if an Italian version is available It could be a solution to implement support in major languages in addition to English Spanish German and Italian
 Not sure I understanding the billing
 Limit of users in our case we are using Publisher plan Not found more cons at the moment they are improving the app so they are removing users problems
 Unable to market my app economicallyThe rated plan to remove this link is too high and is no longer economical to market my app 
 It would be best if every it would allow user names and passwords without the use of an external verification source such as google 
 That you cant really code when you need special or complicate things That if you dont buy a pro license the sync up is very slow
 Formulas entry on spreadsheets using fill helps I would like to see something like that if possibleI would like to see format options on column structure to change the size and format of individual questions
 esta un poco enrredado la confoigracion de pantallas
 When I had a problem with muy apps the custom Service didnt a solución form my problem because they couldnt reproduce it The problem ocurred just entering todo the app
 It has its limitation right nowI am hoping this is a development problem so that this is something that keeps getting betterFor instance I would like to have the gps   map functionality report the schools churches malls restaurants points of interest such as parks on the mapAs a realtor I created a app that shows my team our listingsIt would be a wonderful thing if I could also say where are the closest schoolsFurther I would then like to with the tap of a button send a feature sheet to the buyers emailThat allows me to ask for a email 
 cloudbased delay my internet connection is so not good I mention it because maybe more can be done with the offline features
 Integrating with APIs is challenging and should be made easier
 Not availlable in french language More UX possibilities could be good Limitations in the design of the user interface Ive experienced slow response of the app with tables over 10000 records sync too long
 Maybe add more workflow and button features within a row of a spreadsheet and to more easily autofill information
 The payment plans were confusing and get costly very quick especially for small companies
 The little support you have when the licenses are not business the lack of instructions to create the applications in the initial stage and the impossibility of using a cloud of the organization itself I have not seen the option Its easy to use when you have learned the basic and then you can start to create useful apps until then you have to read and look youtube tutorials And that its not to hard you just need to put some effort to it
 If you leave it for a while it takes a couple of hours to get the hang of it again 
 Some limits in UI UX that limit the experience
 The price is too high considering the many alternatives available out there
 none the cost for White Label android and iphone was a bit expensive
 Pages are difficult to really design as the platform is highly reliant on pulling from the spreadsheet I would like more flexibility in laying out page views and organizing the menu structures 
 Like anything of this nature it does require to practice and playing to understand the features To a complete newbie they may not understand some of the protections you need to build in in order to protect your spreadsheet data especially when multiple users might edit things but the settings to do so are in the app It is also a lot simpler than many other no code options and could be a great way for someone to build some personal data tools to make their life easier
 It gets quite pricey when you add more users to your app than just yourself Id use it a lot more if they expanded the amount of unique visitors to the app 
 takes a little bit of time to sync data back to the spreadsheet
 Almost the whole functionality depends on the spreadsheet in the background This means the spreadsheet companies Google spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel
 deployment and cloud configuration seemed quite complex
 Adding logic and some more complex stuff can be tricky Trying to do simple things such as changing the UI is not as simple unless you thoroughly understand the system The lack of more complex working examples ones using multiple tables with relational connections and more complex workflows Please see if you can get these from companies with redacted data We would be willing to provide once we are through the first few stages of our system rebuild scheduled over the next  months
 After the initial set up converting the massive amounts of example data to a usable format for my project would have taken more time than it was worth for the scale of my project For a small but longterm project or small business it could very well be worth it
 the UI is very limited but this makes sense given the ease of connecting data points without custom code The data graphing tools are sometimes clunky and take coaxing to work correctly I would also like to see linking directly to errors within the editor to ease them and a more robust syntax editor with explanations while typing similar to googles equation editor
 I wish they could support and give an option to use Microsoft Office because google docs do not have all the options as Microsoft office does 
 somehow slow to sync
 new updates are released with a minor bugs
 The loading It takes too long to reload after any minor change However the end product makes up for the slow loading times its total useless even when you want to create a holiday dinner app it cant be elaborated one cant add other dishes other than the ones that are by default offered in the program the place of the dinner on the map is also set by default and cant be changed
 Its still in hyper development so new features are getting added daily making it very hard to keep up
 THERE IS NO PRINT FUNCTION WOULD BE GREAT GOOD TO IMPROVE THE LAYOUT CUSTOMIZATION AND ALSO SAME FOR THE COLOUR FONTS ETC
 I wish their was a simple way to have one app with various logins instead of having to create a new app everytime someone joins our team
  Limited functionality and lack of support for more complex applications
 excessive the price for the subscription plus
 Dont allow to export table schema and its app formulas to another app
 Would like an autosync feature for very simple apps perhaps incorporating this feature into the Actions sections so that simple status updates could be more automated
 Feel the documentation on deployment could be better explained as well as the documentation on the variable roll up into reports The present examples are fine if you are a programmer not so much if you are a novice  beginner They leave out essential elements of the process and do not go in depth into details of reports
 solo in inglese e poco video sul web non si trovano esperti in rete
 Lack of formulae documentation
 The one widespread con about this software is that there is a Share link to share the app that cannot be removed It is a known issue and although there is a workaround it is not pretty
 If your new to building apps or databases you may have to learn some terminology to use it fully 
 sometimes very complicated
 This software is not even in a proper beta stage Simply speakingtoo buggy too simplistic too slow and definitely not mature enough to even charge for itAs it is currently it does not add value and its simply a waste of time
 In the past Ive had some debugging errors The error messages themselves were a bit vague However in the past few months Ive noticed improvements in this area And customer service is always there to help
 As an enduser I cant figure out what I dont like about this softwareFor me this makes mobile app development enjoyable in an easy way
 Documentation is somewhat lacking Probably written by software engineers that developed the product It needs to be geared more towards nontechnical users That said there is a great user community to pick up the slack
 It could make it easier if drag and drop functions were introduced also will be very nice if you could get resources from your computer storage
 The software is not as easy only in terms of understanding which sections you are working in to make changesOnce the understanding of the app terminology has been gained it becomes easier to use 
 Format change is very difficult or near by impossible style to use is very difficult not free so need to purchase A bit unfair that I gave them a  star on ease of use because compared to doing this natively Appsheet makes mobile app creation a breeze But there are some gotchas that will take a little getting used to Well worth the learning curve overall
 Need more time to explore for no experienced user this might be challenging to them I am not sure about the price to deploy an app from using this software
 the limited users for trial version so we dont make a good organize team so im so disappointed if the limited users for trial version
 Not editable front page with link etc my data automation became simpleand i have developed many small apps to check my experience on datasheet
 the custom designs in AppSheet are great but I will appreciate it if there are more of them 
 So many optionsits takes a little time understanding how they all work Formulas editor could be improved Sometimes not so fast probably due to google spreadsheet
 I liked what I saw but it can take a couple of hours to get the hang of it
 It is little bit slow while using due to which little bit irritated and hope you will try to resolve this issue
 shearing is not easy u had given freedom only understand the soft no freedom for users fr small size apps
 Sometimes the support documents arent exactly clear but I havent had a question I didnt eventually find an answer to
 Its a little deficient in the number of features it has Poor documentation Not enough videos advanced function
 The cost but its still great value we just get screwed in NZ because of the exchange rate
 I find it very hard to tweak the UI enough to really produce an app that isnt instantly recognizable as a WYSIWYG type appPerhaps that isnt the case for everyday users but for developers and techie type people its easy to spot
 I would say that you need an IT professional to get them properly uploaded and running in the AppThats expected to be honest everything cant be too easy
 Sometimes when new features are introduced bugs and errors are also introduced Sometimes I load information slowly and others not
 Since there is so much margin to grow on this platform you tend to start feeling a bit restricted with the features available
 Sometimes it takes couple seconds to load on the phone and the tutorials can be complicated to read I have been getting answers from other users However app sheets improved a lot from the last time I used it couple months ago
 Trying to identify best way to build an App which lends itself to sometimes inefficient builds
 The mindset of just working with Sheets and Sheets formulas can be a challenge for someone used to working with traditional developing languages Trying to determine what my bots were doing was hard at first though this may just be a mindset shift for me
 It gives you a limited chance to configure userinterface of your app
 You just need to use it constantly so you get more familiar with the all the tools 
 It could be difficult for someone not so great with spreadsheetsThey now may lack some functionalities i wish to see in the app but they do progress really fast
 The sample apps are great to help you learn the conceptual possibilities for appsheet Id love to see more code recipes for different use casesIf I have a map of code that I know works I can usually figure out how to make it work in my situation
 Had some issues with accessing previous records Would like the ability to modify displaysFor instance default of Small Medium and Large is to generic
 There are not many options to change the look of the app There is a fixed outline of how the app looks like
 Lack of real documentation You need to sift through a user message board or a basic online knowledge base when you have questions or get stuck 
 It would be nice to have the choice of the Italian language during app setup For someone is not good with english make not so simple to help
 There is not enough information to be able to tie this into my CRM that being quickbase Also theres no way to change your password from what I can tell 
 Requiressome digging
 The product promise is to allow a nondeveloper to create an own app easily but you need to understand the basics of sw development anyway
 slow response it takes toolong to save changes and it slows development time something should be done to make it respond quickly all the changes made on apps
 Help locating apk file after transfer of ownership has been an issue that Ive spent several days researching in order to resolve and launch throwing off my schedule 
 It could be a little more interactive when it comes to the learning process There are tutorials and videos but nothing to walk you through the basics that you can play with
 Would be great to have a little more flexibility on formatting ie centrealign individual columns in table mode
 Not clear direction on how to get started and how to get the most out of it definitely more developer than layman facing
 Sometimes I feel that there should be more help infoIn other words more detail in the help pages
 it only have minimum user per app in free mode but still your app is still usable even if you have exceeded the max limit user
 Needs a more robust sweet of built in functions
 I know the english is the most common language for software developers butI had some issues working with people in spanish and portuguese 
 Authentication is only with external providers The ui is more adapted to tablet and mobile devices rather than desktop classic device 
 Lack branching function when designing the form sequential logic could be implemented to allow dynamically auto populate the next field entry based on the previous field
 No centralized list of commandsAn SDK or API or single document would be much more useful than the current scattershot wikilike approach
 I didnt succeed in receiving data processed on the spreadsheet directly into a form page for example 
 need to do manually and when error occur take time to find where is wrong
 everything is not intuitive and the documentation is not very good so it sometimes takes a long time to figure out a basic function
 For complex projects its difficult to implement
 Understandably features are a little limited and it is quite simplistic Not recommended for anything too compelx
 I wish there would be more how to videos but overall software is very user friendly and great tool for anyone trying to make life a lot easier
 predefined forms there is no option to create a custom froms with over options mainly for a feedback collection
 aesthetics could be improved look and feel can be greatly improved more themes and backgrounds to be added
 I dont like the fact that i have to purchase the product before I can fully implement with all the bells and whistles 
 Formulas are not obvious when user community grows over the allocated threshold the warming message is difficult to get rid of
 I know next to nothing about app development Im sure there is a tonne of functionaality I cant use
 More intuitive UI
 need more function related to the external device like printer
 Reporting Some difficulties making updates Lack of desktop tool to speed development Syncing to web slows development
 There should be live support for any user of this platform to solve the questions in real time
 A few additional features would make it an absolute world beater
 The language You should have translations in other languages so it is easier for international users to manage
 Theme Costume and Iconless need more additional icon to used at applicationalso need more app theme
 The admin user interface is confusing to find where is where which is something i liked the least about the software
 the filtering is not enough for me also some views are useless should have more options for this issue
 The user interface can be enhanced a bit It looks sometimes monotonous while displaying the app to the user
 No Support littered with bugs doesnt feel like it was built 
 all the formula that need to try many times only can find the correct one
 I find it hard to understand deploying check It should give you a link to detailed information on how to fix errors
 Documentation support forums it s hard to find specific answers for problems I had The tutorial videos are just too long mentioned that the explanations are very very clear I would like more charts Its kind of expensive the medium plan
 Not easy to register users needs better administration features and registration of users
 Lack of guidance for starter and difficulty in exploring
 Timely user friendly cheap and accuracy 
 The versions with all features are slightly priced higher Sometimes we get debugging errors and the explanations are hard to understand
 Some thing went wrong when we have moredata
 A LITTLE TEDIOUS WITH EXPRESSIONS
 No off online
 too expensive for what i needed
 no spanish instructions
 Gets pricey when you exceed the number of users
 Free version is pretty slow compared to the purchased version The company should focus on making even the free version user friendly to attract more developers
 It can have a bit of a learning curve and there are certain issues as you create bigger and more complex apps but the only real limit on this is the user 
 Pricing maybe too expensive despite of the function
 No default values
 I cant really customize by adding buttons to other resources very well for a personal appSuch as my personal calendar
 Troubleshooting a problem can be tough as the app developers using this tool are relatively new to this experience
 AppSheet could be easy to learn but you have to be willing to understand from the start The learning curve will take a few tries but when you get it it is easier
 Could make the error details section a bit more enhanced
 I DONT LIKE THE PAY OR THE COSTI DONT LIKE THAT IT REQUIRES The INTERNET FOR DEVELOPMENT I WOULD LIKE THE DESK VERSION WHICH ISFREE IN THE PC
 Column Structure under Data that does not have the ability to be sorted as is UX tables and menu order 
 creating an app
 I would like to be able to choose the themes of background and menu colors using html codeIwould also like to be able different types of buttons Some of my coworkers would prefer choose differents Language to
 Unconventional Flowchart sometimes i lost myself in many browser windows
 Navigating through process i think Appsheet is working diligently to make the user interface more friendly so was just a have to wait and see
 Managing relations between various tables lists objects Pricing is relatively high in case the app number of users is big
 As expected the free version is not that good It is better that you save your time and start using the paid version
 need more free features in order to use it frequently need to give us more accounts for testing and using
 More formatting optionsspecifically for Enumlists being able to put a single item per linethe ability to import icons for buttons Also a way to easily import data from the administrator side while allowing the App to stay read only Easier way to embed videos
 time to load
 I wish errors on deployment check would take you to where you can correct the error
 The app does not integrate every tools for every apps I want to make an app that resemble spotify or any kind of player but it does not have what it takes to do that
 It would be fantastic to enhance their qualities at the personal user level in the same way that you have to work at a business level
 It took some time to become familiar with software better to add user helping service such as chat bot For the beginners it is hard to learn about software
 Must have good knowledge of programming to set up correctly and have good user interface and ease of use Takes time but worth it
 Documentation could be a little more extensive Maybe something like a manual or library of already developed apps
 Actually there is little of what I do not like about this application but the detail may be the cost it seems a little high cost per month for the premium service
 I wish it was easier to individualize how each users app looked It was quite tedious to go through each of the views I made and change them per user
 Give more options on apps and develop more design possibilities put on Appsheet website videos to help use and explain like training
 after a period time of trial i need to pay for the services
 The style to use is quite difficult This software is not free so have to purchase Other than that pretty good
 For more practical that is filling and query data through the application couldnt find anything where I can turn into computed data chart
 speed maybe not that quicklyIf it could integrated with more database or system  eg SAP Oracle  It will be really useful for enterprise user 
 that for small favours we get charged Even when i made small adjustments to the app and though the copied app didnt have any warning I was getting charged
 Slow response to adjustments of features and functionalityThis should happen for any normal API
 Takes some time and attention to understand how if worksTo me there was one initial challenge which was to understand what I could do with Appsheet
 Less flexibility than doing this from scratch Difficult at times to organize the spreadsheet in a way that the software understands it
 I mainly use these kind of apps for capturing data  i would like to have various forms of dashboards  infographics to communicate my data 
 When expanding to more complex applications the compiling errors could be more informative and better integrated help would be great
 Little jargon
 iPad editing
 More graphics options definitions os font types and sizes 
 The price point for the more premium features of the Appsheet like having apps that require multiple users is a bit high when compared to other options in the market
 If GPS options are included it would be awesome
 If you dont have a basic understanding of programming logic some of the features will be difficult to understand
 It can be a bit of a poor workflow experience in the editor The ability to cusotmize things is great
 There is little resources available for the more advanced features More tutorials on how to use build apps would be very helpful
 sometime errors are confusing and it takes time to figure out what is wrongContacting Customer Support through email is slow
 Ive found it difficult to synchronise oftentimes the servers were off or some problem ocurred It is not easy to change entered data
 There could be some improvements but is so easy to connect via excel that its good enough for now
 Can improve by auto detect the image files and the way the file is optimized for mobile view 
 Could be more user friendly For a new user there is lots of confusion in how to deploy the freeware as an app
 Complex sorting functions are not intutitive
 Though personal apps are free if for business it is per monthly and that gets to be pricey There is also very little offered for customizationIt can also be a little difficult for some people to use
 It would be easier to use this app with tooltips defining every single input located on frames
 With so many features it takes some time to learn
 You need to pay to have full feature It will be great if it is totally free
 Generating a certain file is such a frustration Once youre done downloading it the spacing paragraph etc are a mess
 When i mess up something in my initial data I have to start from scratch I wish you could easily modify your spreedsheet without getting an error and having to start over
 no programming interface found for developersi know this for every people you should add proograming interface too
 There was a bit of a learning curvefor nonprogrammers but I think thats to be expected I would appreciate more workflow functions 
 It could get a bit pricey if the company is not paying for the software 
 Something that not very specific month is the subject of the formulas of the columns I do not know if it is because I do not have many experience in programming
 What a great chance for me to use this great software in my life time I will use this for my life time
 There are weaknesses but the pros FAR outweigh the consXanocom and TheBDKcom really shine where Bubble is sometimes weak I truly wish the team would make it their number  priority to address the backend UI interface especially when it comes to interacting with CRM data it feels completely messy and confusing As a designer it some times shocks me how poorly its designed a simple look at Figma or even the notsogreat UI of Webflow makes Bubble look from the 80s in UI It is time for a big improvement there for the sake of its current users and future ones What bubble makes up in speed of development it reduces the scalability of it Bubble is 10X more expensive than any other software we use Bubble costs us more in hosting than our office rent making it almost impossible for us to sell it to a client and we have lost a lot of clients due to bubbles expensive rates
 The dynamic data source entry boxes where you can use no code thinking access both simple grab the data from a data field or another component on the page  and complex merge the results of a database search with a list just entered by the user and stored in the page But the entry box is small and too tightly prompted Just making it larger would be an improvement I dont like how all options sets and plugin data are loaded with every page even when that page doesnt make use of it I believe it affects pageloading performance 
 I wish that Bubble had a built in way to manage user payments so I didnt have to rely on an external tool like Stripe I also think there could be improvements to the visualization of data logs and more transparency into what went wrong with a backend workflow when theres an error Finally the feature I want the most is support for creating native iOS and Android apps
 Debug mode is a little difficult to use and understandLogging is very difficult to useDeployment functionality works but version history and control could use some more loveCurrent plans make collaboration a bit difficult The price jump between Profession and Production is huge and quite often you want to have multiple app editors while you get your application up and running before it is production readyNot easy to use your own custom backend this would be a huge win for enterprise clients
 I think the learning curve is pretty steep When you start you immediately see the potential of Bubble but to achieve what you really want you need to work a lot and learn a lot 
 It is very difficult for a nontechnical person to understand all these new concepts I had to train myself and it was long and difficult But I really wanted to be able to create sites by myself without anyones help 
 Sometimes performance but i have small instances so i will test it more
 Extremely demanding data work isnt great in Bubble but easy to do in other tools and API what you need in out
 Id like to have it on a Spanish version
 Bubble is expensive slow and not a serious companyThey changed to an overpriced model overnight and didnt keep their promises of deadlines of updating these plans to the old modelThe support is awful they dont even read your messages and answer with generic texts and dont solve your problem The system is at times very clunky and there are definitely things that could be improved like the speed of the system even with only a couple of users and hidden elements appearing for a split second on page load before being hidden again but its all things you learn to work around Also although its supposedly nocode and no prior experience necessary and all that jazz it definitely a software you have to study extensively to understand Ive been building on this for over a year and Im still in the dark about 40% of its functionality its a little misleading to say its for novices Also they could make a few common integrations a bit more accessible complete The collective time saved if they curated and refined their integrations a bit more would be much appreciated unability to host your data in EU this is very very important for EU citizen and it will become more and more important Thing is this is just my point of view European people will use a side back end xano supabaseor even airtable which is now working on EU office instead of using 100% of your solution Your custom plan allow to select the region but its quite expensive so people work with another back end solution  In the near futur data location will be very important for everyone as you know better than me and im frankly scared that you not make the move quickly enough so people will go with full other solutions and open source solutions more things it would be great if the editor could run faster on google chrome and last thing as i told you i invested a lot of time learning your solution if you change your pricing and make a per line as you tried few months ago pricing im scared you will lose a lot of people again
 Our biggest frustrations with Bubble are extent to which we have to copy and paste instead of reuse elements lack of change management for custom code inside of modules eg custom JS currently there is no way to interact with GraphQL APIs no way to get paid priority support from team some issues with point & click UI
 The customer support service is not great as they take more hours and sometimes a day to address a particular ticket
 Imagined for non developers but requiring developer understanding to really make the best use of It is currently in between these two target markets and needs to support devs agencies more
 It could be a bit faster in loading time
 It takes a little time to understand but honestly thats true of any complex software It used to be a little slow but seems to be greatly improved lately
 The mobile part While with the new responsive engine we can create easily mobile version I wouldve loved to have more options to deploy the apps into the main stores Also the design part of the UI of the pages could include more options like what Framer propose for example I feel like the cons are more of a misuse of Bubble than flaws of Bubble My issues today are how to integrate my Bubble products with classic internal product with their lengthy cycles of developmentPerformance issues can happen if data tables are not wellthought and not suited for the Repeating Groups its used in or with too much complexity in a page but that shows limit of scaling that is inherent to a nocode tool1 con that is kind of painful my data tables were set with lengthy field names and now every time I modify an existing database entry half of the filed names are cut Small formatting fix or line break could really help
 The latency Whenever I built an app with bubble I find out that the other solution build with real programmers in market is faster In the last two years they had few downs that lasted way too much In the last six month didnt happen anymore I recently had problems with corrupted cacheand in general you cannot be 100% sure thata page will immediately retrieve updated dataOn the admin side I find they should improve the management of scheduled workflows the interface is very basic and you cant download themThey should provider an easier way to wrap for mobile
 People said to me that Bubble is difficult to learn I agree Many Bubblers claimed to be professional since there is no industrywide recognition like the traditional code In addition I think Bubble needs to focus more on the enterprise space 
 Honestly there isnt much I dislike about Bubble I would say having the ability to deploy native mobile apps to the App Store and Google Play would be nice Like all software Bubble has its quirks to get used to Want to clear certain things in your app like a field in a database? Well the delete icon doesnt always fully delete youll need to find the Optimise application button deep in your settings and fully delete thereBubble also thrives on its plugins for the best functionality However plugins are a mixed bag Bubble doesnt do much quality checking so some just dont do what you need them to Plugin documentation is often thin on the ground or totally nonexistent even for plugins Bubble publish themselves Sometimes documentation for a plugin is a 1000+ post thread on the Bubble Forum imagine searching StackOverflow but every problem about that language was in one enormous thread which makes it really difficult to find a solution for your problem Relying on plugins also means Bubble is reliant on its community continuing to maintain these plugins I hope that with time Bubble is looking to build in some of the features of its most popular plugins to the core app to secure both its own business and the workings of the businesses that make Bubble apps Bubble are great with support queries but feeding back anything that isnt a bug can be difficult They have an ideaboard where users can upvote good ideas but its unclear what priority these ideas fall under or if theyre in scope at all The Bubble Forum is unreliable many posts get no helpful replies even fewer get replies from Bubble staff
 Bubble does not allow exporting the source code of your project If this is super important to you then Bubble might not be the best option to run your project longterm You can export your data but not the source code its a bummer because down the line you might want to have better control of your app and you need access to the code but you cant and thats just it Its major achilles heel for me is the expression system both for allowing more complex logic and better expression editor right now is a mess editing an existing dynamic expression Implement a good condicional logic case if along with internal expression variables let would allow making almost anythingThis is really a huge thing it is difficult to describe how this impacts or may impact an app the complex logic and expressions complex conditional expressions better editing variables is the 50% of a complex real application Improving this would make Bubble a fantasy a total killer solution
 Responsiveness can be a burden at times but if you think out your build before hand mobile vs desktop its definitely workable 
 What I liked least about Bubbleio is that the learning curve can be steep especially for those who are not familiar with web development concepts Additionally while the platform offers a lot of customization options it can be challenging to get certain features and functionalities to work exactly as intended Debugging and troubleshooting can be timeconsuming especially when dealing with complex workflows Also lack of documentations is annoying Out of the box Bubble has some significant limitationsAnd my problem with it is that there are user built workarounds for many or most of them but theres no intuitive way to figure out which limitations are absolute and which can be overcome using plugins or wacky workaroundsLike you can only upload 200 rows of data at a time to Bubble unless you happen to know about a plugin that allows you to do unlimited uploads but only by jumping through hoops that you wont figure out yourself until someone shows you how to get past itOr you cant take data in one data type and create different data types from itWell actually you can but you have to use a backend workflow to do it which is not obviousOnce you see it its easy but until someone shows you you wouldnt think to try the solutionAt least I and my team didntAlso I really wish they would use more standard language in their naming conventions Bubble data types should be tables Bubble things should be rows or even objectsIt makes it really hard to describe what you are doing with people when we cant get a handshake on what the words mean
 Performance like I said very poor for ecommerce and even for an app to use every day as a team And the second on is hat we can read the DB fastly when it comes to advanced filters We have to think about workarounds which oblige us to store the data twice which is a lot of work and even with that this is not that easy to do One of the limitations of Bubble is that the API Connector cant handle API Responses that contain nested arrays This means were unable to use Bubble when working with large data sets or to display graphs when using these types of API responses Additionally the process of having to use API Workflows to save items to separate lines in the database can be a bit tricky As were not using this app on a daily basis it takes some time to refresh your memory on how to do this correctly Also dont expect 100% accuracy in saving data to the database using this method It sometimes misses out some of rows in the table which can cause problems if you need a prototype that is completely flawless
 Maybe the workflow editor the ability to categorize some workflows
 Performance and limitations on features within different pricing tiers can outprice it for some projects Plugins are unreliable and easily broken unless Built by Bubble ruling out many very promising and useful thirdparty offerings
 The components library can be improved to save huge amount of time But some exists out of the box but need additional subscription on third party partners It could save tons of hours to have prebuilt page templates and configurable small components like xclosing window popups menus etc just like we can style every type of input text button etc it could be nice to be able to build and save our small component library maybe it can be done with reusable elements but its not that clearHave some wizard to set up the basic layout in the most efficient way could be nice main menu with Option set and Repeating group single index page with hiding groups with url parameters on that same menu option set etc Bubble does require some coding not in the traditional sense like cortan or C++ But it has its own language which is sometimes difficult to figure outBubble lacks report printing but it is handled by 3rd parties which increases cost
 Cant think of anything negative to say about bubble
 I found the initial steps confusingSome of the language is simultaneously too simple and confusing eg Thing is ambiguous and concepts like Data Source and Type of Data need to be explained fully at the outset I never found thisLuckily I understood relational databases but Bubble simplifies this concept to such and extent that it makes one worry that somethings being missedWhen getting into more complicated aspects of Bubble its the community that helps out via the Forum or YouTubeYouTubes are often far too long or simply incomprehensible and it can be hugely frustrating trying to arrive at a solution and often there is simply SO much information to read its impossible
 The biggest challenge for us was responsiveness and changing the height of elements within pages and groups Some helpful improvements would be more settings to change in responsiveness view quick tips for commonly faced problems in responsiveness related to height automatically diagnosed So for example if an element that in the editor covers the whole page but when the page size changes this element will not be covering the whole page because of a group or something you can suggest how to fix it
 The responsive page design is a bit hard to get your head around at first and sometimes you get slightly erratic results I believe they are making some improvements to this in a coming release but it is useable even now
 fact it is bounded in its flexibility but It would not be so easy to use
 Its probably because I need to learn more but I find adapting to all sizes of devices is a bit a trial and error situation For example the responsive engine rendered nicely on my android phone but did not display as nicely on an older iPhone Again I probably need more time to nail this one down
 Its mainly for MVP or for some small to mediumscale projects I mentioned you can make a replica of powerful platforms but not at that scale You can replicate the functionalities but only a few thousand of users will be able to use it at once 
  Some things required creative workaroundsAlso the pricing at the highest tier is more expensive than I would like Most of these are being actively worked on but some disadvantages are Managing styling and responsive design can be challengingDebugging when using external tools integrations can be difficult without access to system logsWhen apps become more complex managing large numbers of workflows pages data types can become somewhat cumbersome note that this is when you have 30+ pages hundreds of workflows and 50+ data types
 The database designer format is unnecessarily complicated wish it was much closer to the DB design tool that is used by knackcom Very slow if you have to manipulate 1000s of records at once
 Not generating a native application for mobile and the speed in handling data import when constant synchronization is needed
 Bubble can be slow at times And has limited mobile app support external solutions like Natively are required
 The lack of official plugins for out of the box integrations with other toolsNot having the possibility for selfhost
 Playing with JSON and custom states in Bubble is sometimes painful It is often easier to transform into Bubble objects but then we loose lot of JS advantages It is very slow All simple operations take very long to load2 It is very expensive If you are on production mode that has still very unacceptable speed you pay over 500USD per month3 The support is slow and not great They charged wrong credit card and dont want to refund it So be aware of financial problems you might experience Absolutely zero control over your code and data You cannot export any part of your product Everything is hosted on their platform They provide only 12hour backups for a FREE plan So if any glitch happens from their side you will completely lose everything and nothing can be recovered A huge learning curve exists So if you are a noncoder wanting to build a working app get ready to spend at least a few months to build a decent prototype Designing responsive pages can be nothing short of a nightmare
 Poor Database integrationPoor database speed and data manipulation speed
 canvas design learning curve for a non dev
 Steep learning curve at the start understanding privacy rules
 This is nitpicking but there are some native styling controls that are missing if youre familiar with web development for eg strikethrough for text CSS grid huge there are pseudoworkarounds but not quite
 It is a little difficult to find information on the inner operations of the system which makes it a bit hard to truly become an expert The system can also be a bit slow to first load which can make you loose a few users
 It took a few weeks to learn itSEO meta etc can be further improved 
 The lack of dynamic widths in the elements it follows that when you change the text you have to adjust all the affected elementsThe speed for complex applications is unfortunately much too slowSome rudimentary elements are missing and can only be supplemented with plugins > But these are usually also not always well implemented The pricing model It would be great to have the possibility to upgrade the needed capacity in smaller steps The other thing that I dont like is the absence of building 2FA into your application is not build in for the smaller pricing plans Increasing security should not be a paidfor option
 Yet impossible to search or sort by fields field relational field Alternatives Considered
 Could be faster It has a bit of a learning curve but that comes with extra power Lacks some CSS properties that would be nice to have No code is not a concept everyone understands so it is sometimes hard to explain the limitations to nontech staff who are only familiar with 100% customized from scratch platforms The limitations are not necessarily bad just tradeoffs for the incredible development speed and ease of use If you have no clue about coding maybe it takes some time to understand how to use the software Once you know how to use it the possibilities youve got to create an APP are ilimited
 Theres a learning curve specifically regarding backend workflows and can take time to get fully comfortable with the software if not coming from a technical background 
 It just took too long to get up to speed with compared to other no code options out there I think if you came from a development background then this could be great or you were looking to build something really sophisticated and didnt want to code then this could be an option
 I definitely think it needs a lot of work on the design side
 It would be cool to be able to collaborate with one other person on the personal plan
 The learning curve is a bit steep and there are a few specific tweaks that could be made but overall the product is great 
 The responsive part That needs to improve a lot but I know they are aware of this
 There is a big learning curve this is not your typical cut and paste web builder but rightfully so the functionality Bubble offers is so complex that a typical cut and paste builder would never be able to handle what Bubble does
 Would be nice to have the ability to select the database location especially for GDPR compliance concerns
 sometimes there are critical failures in the platform Which leads to spending many hours trying to fix them
 It really needs to improve mobile compatibility as generating native apps
 Im not a programmer so I had to spend some time to learn how to build in the tool I asked for help some times and I was capable to build an entire platform to run a business this is the only weak point but its not abou the tool its about me
 Hard to say what I liked the least because the Bubble project is very smart
 UI of the editor and backendlisting workflows horizontally and not vertically is terribleAnd the editor popup is always in the way in the workflow viewWe need margin auto new app data view is bad I HAVE to use the search function to find my thingeach view should show the number of constraints it has[just a little number tag to show if this is all of the users or did I apply a constraint yesterday that I forgot about]
 bubble would be great tools if it support google sheet built in integration
 Not clear how to build workflows integrate external data bases APIs and build more intelligent systems using machine learning algorithms 
 Bubble is surprisingly scalable but optimizing performance is difficult and hackyI am used to being able to optimize custom apps using caching database indexing etcI think it would be possible for Bubble to implement some of this performance customization but I think theyre just not focused on it Collaborative features ie more than  developer working simultaneously on an app is hard and requires some more work
 It makes particular choices about how to implement elements and actions that are not always intuitive and are often not documented So very often you have to figure out a workaround in order to do something that ought to be straightforward
 Speed of the apps which are built on the bubble has been a bit on the lower side Though Bubble has taken steps to make it faster it still remains to be one of the challenges which most of the bubble users face
 should make native apps for android and apple
 Id love to see more improvements around designing in Bubble eg controlling grids using classes hosting becomes expensive but its easy enough to integrate other storage solutionsProcessing huge amounts of data becomes slower depending on complexity
 Bubble is still in its nascent stages so integrations and API calls are glitchy and lagging It would have been much better if Adobe suite of products could be simply imported just like Figma When importing an illustrator file the format palette all corrupts leading to a situation where you are forced to create all the UI again on bubble 
 While many things are easy without code some things are easier with code All sorts of algorithmic stuff with loops and calculations should be available eg as JavaScript functions callable from the expressions like VBA i Excel This is a serious limitationNo concept of parameterised reusable elements When inserting a reusable object it should be possible to pass in parameters for the reusable object to be configuredNot possible to preview when editing reusable elementNo concept of Tennant means that having many clients means entering Tennant in each and every database operation
 All these freedom come with relevant limits and poor UI performance compared to actual code Theres no way to create a native app You can create a web page that looks like an app but the performance is poor Also theres no access to the code so what you build is lockedin in their platform 
 The learning curve is serious Ive reviewed a lot of tutorials on Bubbles site and on Youtube and like Photoshop feel as if Im under a constant learning curve regardless of my experience level If you can get past the learning curve things get better
 gets expensive with growthdifficult to document the product
 I didnt have any bad experiences with bubble
 API Integration is friendly for people who has done it before for starters they still have to learn about it
 The pricing model for the plugins is really bad You cannot test them you need to buy them and figure out how to use them The documentation is not integrated some of the plugins dont work well The support level is inexistent even if you pay
 More control and insight into backend processes to make large scale apps robust
 Bubble development should be much faster What I mean is that the bubble tool itself is so slow that it takes forever to load and work with it It becomes a big bottleneck Im constantly bouncing these days Also there are too many dead bugs You get issues that werent there in the deployment you get an issue you press it it goes away and it freaks people out 
 no source code boost system is weird design
 Responsive engine is challenging to master but it can be done with patience I think it would definitely have been WAY harder to learn if I didnt already have coding   web development experience already The learning curve was less steep because Ive built sites before but I dont know how fit this is for someone with  experience
 Support is only by email but support responded in good time and manner
 Data deployment is functional but not elegant Would like to have more classic logic like if then else case or switch logic blocks in workflow The workflow do unless logic is a bit clunky at times But you get used to it 
 I think that the tools for design are hard to build
 It currently doesnt have the ability to perform loops
 The new pricing plan is a killer especially for new users 
 No mobile native apps developmentNo offline capability
 It is worth mentioning that users who are not comfortable with technology as a whole may need more time to learn the basic concepts functions and how to use Bubbleor any other nocode tool If youre comfortable with most digital tools and platforms shy of a few hours of handson use to get familiar with new UI UX youll be totally fine If you struggling logging on to emailhighly recommend taking the time to work your way through the Bubble courses and lessons designed for absolute beginners
 Bubble simply isnt set up for mobile Building one page apps on bubble makes the editor extremely slow and clunky and it adds tons of development time Please bubble think about those building on your platform that are focused on mobile 
 Porem os planos não são baratos e você tem pouco espaço em nuvem Para ficar perfeiro o ecosistema Falta suporte para gerar aplicativos nativos em ios e android
 Slowness and datalimits is not good enough for professional users
 The overall page load speed outside the US can be improved with local servers in Europe and other countries
 Steep learning curve It takes new users a few months before they can build productionready apps on Bubble
 Installing external libraries have to be done through a custom plugin
 The ability to generate native app for iOS and Android
 Os preços são baratos quando tu tem orçamento já Como no Brasil o dólar é caro o plano mais básico pode ser caro para validar uma ideia
 Sometimes not that stable Property manager not that easy to follow 
 The data and workflow sections are not very intuitive I wish there was also a canvas to design the workflow
 Its only for websites and not for native mobile apps
 Lack of TypeScript usage or more modern async JavaScript syntax Passwordless signup would be great too
 Better Grids where we are just relying on RGSimple maths functions like ABS MOD etcAbility to copy   paste or replicate some stuff as librarySearch feature in sql plugin to find where each code is used
 The biggest con is the lockin effect Especially when not using a dedicated server
 I have some restrictions on passing GET information from url I couldnt create custom links from page filters
 UI is confusing not mobilefirst and lags behind many other platforms that focus on design whereas Bubble focuses on functionality
 versioning!! Development and Live are fine When you start dealing with more than that this is still unclear if data is merged correctly So many errorsif the SQL connector could allow us to put a dynamic value for our database connection string that would be awesome Merges are a pain in the  when you have different back Databases
 The responsive settings even after learning exactly how they work still feel less than optimal and do on occasion prevent me from building sites for some people If that were ironed out I would build everything I could on Bubble
 DesignLack of very designed template for landing page for example 
 Logic od doing simple mathematics not structured like Computer Science theory models or guidelines
 Like Webflow Bubbles UI can be more difficult to learn than some other drag and droptype builders but once you get going the suite of tools and level of customization is really powerful 
 The ability to have dynamic fonts and font size
 It lacks some basic UX compared to other tools like webflow
 The only thing I wish was available was an option for a free trial So users can test thier MVP before paying for the service Right now the current test version of my app has watermarks which makes the UI look messy
 Still a little difficult to manage when you have no technical background
 I am concerned about EU GDPR regulation Currenly only option offered by bubble dedicated servers which is very expensive
 The asynchronous nature of the database makes it unstable for data consistency 
 Performance to scale the number of tables and rows
 I may have missed this but it would be nice if there are more resources to find out how to maximize Bubbles utility
 Maybe bubble needs to simplify connections with other databases
 I missed a better way input data like posting data on database with more complexity arrays lists with arrays
 Design layout and responsiveness is tricky not as straightforward as Id like it to be
 Not very intuitive Visual interface needs some work App Data tab for admin view of database is weak   terrible2 No support for downloading CSV reports across joins of multiple tables3 Design tool lacks templates   automation for common tasks like creating a form
 Some functionalities for example the use of parenthesis in logical conditions order The only down point I can come up with is I wish we could have users under the progression plan
 It is a little difficult to learn how to use Bubble but everyone weve trained has caught on
 At first the limitation of the design model making all applications look the same But with the update of the responsiveness module it improved a lot in this regard
 Probably need more SEO tech to rank higher in Google Other than that easy mailing to our database users seems a bit tricky Also Chrome runs smoothly but Safari has some designwise problems with my app
 Lack of native app deployment option sometimes it can be super slow with complex calculations or multistep tasks Maybe its my fault and there is a faster better way to build some functions 
 I find the UI associated with developing responsive layouts a bit overbearing particularly if youre just mocking up a usable concept for testing
 I was able to use all the elements that I needed so could not comment on this
 There not something I particularly dislike Im only wondering what my app performance will look like once I hit hundreds of users
 You cant launch an app in the free tier So if youre an aspiring entrepreneur or just someone just testing an idea you cant validate it Also once you build it will be hard to move the application to another backend to save costs
 On ne peut pas toucher au code Les bugs ne salissent jamais 
 Performance of editor I have a SPA app and is difficult to work because there is a lag time to use Capacity for backups
 I dont like the app segmentation Meaning that you have to pay a fixed price for every deployment individually It makes lighter apps not very cost effective compared to more complex ones
 really difficult to integrate with external tools and debug
 Learning process is not so fast as you think in the start You need just to switch in the head and think in Bubble way
 There is a high learning curvebut so does anything complex So that is not a negative just to be aware
 Quite difficult to master I would highly recommend to have knowledge in coding concept at least to use Bubble 
 ux of builder can use an update more user friendly
 To this day I have found that anything that I was missing was due to my lack of knowledge 
 You have to let aside your previous dev logic and understand new way to implement Its not a weakness just something you have to go through like first wave when you go surfing
 Responsive development for mobile is a bit tricky I think it should be easier to do
 Algumas coisas poderiam ser nativa do bubble sem necessidade de plugins de teerceiros
 I wish bubble support answered quicker and there was more education on complex APIs for beginners I wish I had more knowledge of databases before i started The list of 3rd party plugins often dont have proper howto documentation
 There is a steep learning curve but it is time well spentI look at my time with bubble as an investment in myself that will pay itself back time and time again Performance in searches could maybe be a bit better more then one domain would be great to have for B2B Modules
 Designing your app on bubble not using figma is very hard and does not produce good results 
 The use of API calls is a problem for me But that doesnt necessarily come from Bubble This difficulty may be related to my lack of technical training
 With the ability to do almost anything comes the complexity of the tool You cant learn it in a few weeks on your own Its matter of months 
 Poor documentation I ever need to search how to do videos on Youtube because the standard documentation and videos arent really useful
 Layout e ferramentas estão bem fracos ainda
 It is not so easy to complement your app with your own code through plugins If you have to code there is no good editor integrated
 Pricing modelShould be able to develop low cost and then pay on release 
 Speed a bit slow at times and bugs that sometimes pop up and complicate things slightly
 The user interface gives a lot to desire
 Exporting to migrate whena businee grow not just for need but much more to reassure investors and shareholders
 Some basic features are missing like document generationSome of the UX is not great All features should be in the free version for a month and there should be plugins for web app to mobile app conversion as there are 3rd party plugins available for this case
 Poor generating reportings like a report sql with headers and footers
 The pricing plans Its too expensive Please provide a cheaper plan billed annually 
 The usability can be clunky and not intuitive in places
 The outdated responsive design and the designing limitation also the low quality plugins and the outdated onces
 Learning Bubble is a little different than traditional app or system development Everything is event driven and it takes a little paradigm shift for people that have done SQL Web development before
 A falta de opção em geração de relaórios
 That chart js is still an old version that we need to rely on plugins to make a pdf of a pageSometimes the pages load slow then using is as an iframe
 Alguns recursos mais avançados não é possível fazer
 Some things could be improved like speed
 Learning curve is steeper than anticipated
 Very easy to use no code is Very easy to do ano app ou program
 honestly this platform is perfect but must be great if bubble can achieve the next level speed performance i believe bubble is working on that
 I wish there was a hosting option for Europe Currently this is only possible for the customtier which is too expensive for most appliations
 Compared to other communities Bubbles community feels like its mostly bubble freelance developers looking to charge you for help
 Server capacityFree TierFunction not available File management must have alternatives of any custome S3 bucketsDatabase must have alternatives to use any postgres on other serversSaas product requiredPay as go required
 The platform is a bit slow I wish it was faster and also I wish they provided more storage with the monthly fees
 Somehow the exchange rate makes bubble expensive I am not sure which exchange platform bubble is using but its really expensive
 The fact that there is no payment gateway to actually test what I have built for Jordan I really wish to see that 
 Content literature available to build our own apps and sample template apps The way that a simple if then else is dificult to do Database results too slow There is not a REPORT TOOL integrated!!Do you already have to do a report in Bubble ??? I believe 95% of applications have a report
 Id like MFA to be available at lower paid tiers
 logiciel un complexe pour un profane en design UI UX Its not autoscaling and to deploy to the app store requires a 3rd party
 The UI to built the front end could be better in eliminating repetitive tasks The first tier its not free anymore opens space to competitors very few free plugins2 hard to find good courses in other languages
 The cost is a bit high when compared with other nocode platforms
 The CMS is really weak While the websites are pretty fast their performance on Google Pagespeed Insights is terrible and this is damaging for SEO
 Linterface pourrait être encore améliorer 
 The SEO and the integration on an existing website is hard or not offered at all or is it just me? 
 External connection with another DB API Interfaces
 Learning curve is steep Data modeling is critical Zapier integration is flaky which is unacceptable for my users
 I wish there were more interactive lessons to demonstrate common processes that a user might want to create in their app 
 not enough interactive components lack of a better grid system for records
 The names they give to the systems components are really weird For instance they name things well objects but they try desperately to avoid using standard programming names An extreme example is something they call states but in the end are just local variables again they refuse to use programmingrelated names I think with negative consequences
 They could perhaps do more to allow users to customize and save chains of workflow processes into one file and make them easily repeatable
 I am still early to determine so far so good
 plug ins and documentation of themsome plug ins do not have clear set up process
 Responsividade complicada e chata para se trabalhar
 Not that I can think of but based on the reviews from other users Bubble pay attention to suggested improvements
 The new responsiveness engine is really not user friendly It makes the app less drag & drop from a design perspective and it confusing from a responsiveness standpoint 
 Qualité très médiocre des plugging tierce
 SEO capabilities like Response time Import funcionality Connection to FTP server
 Like any appbuilding platform the learning curve can be a quite steep and this can be a slight barrier with Bubble
 It could be faster and have more features like Elementor has for building websites
 User Interface handling for responsive devices needs improvement
 Although its a great no code platform you need to spend some time on it learning and understanding the building process
 Its a bit specialized and not extremely user friendly 
 I havent experienced any displeasure yet
 Sometimes felt limited with the tools available for designing the front end API connector plugin seemed glitchy at times 
 It was sometimes to maneuver through the app from the noncoding side and the coding side of Bubble was a bit confusing at times I suggest trying to differentiate between the two sides 
 Bubble is super powerful but you do need to put in the work upfront it has a fairly steep learning curve especially for people who arent familiar with web or app development That said once you get it you can build pretty much anything
 La curva de aprendizaje es larga y está todo en inglés No hay casi información para aprender a utilizar la plataforma en español
 Needs more tweeks of the user interfaceScalability & speed with larger databases & programs not yet convincing
 I liked how workflows worked but felt the user interface for the workflow page was a bit ugly and i found it hard to track and view all my workflows and the content inside each workflow 
 a layout bug needs to be fixed in all views containing such a layout
 I wish there were more collection of templates for app home page
 When adding features and functionalities to my web pages I found it to be so hard and complicated tools provided by the platform are difficult to use I spared hours to read through their material and watch their videos but those material are so poor and unhelpful
 The gui is good but some of the text are small and sometimes i overlook it when looking for ot but overall it does not affect the whole development process 
 When I deploy the product sometimes it brokes
 Apart from the price which can hinder startupsMore features modules and integrations should be added and improved
 Lack of Ability to create Native AppsLack of ability to Host the App on a personal Hosting Server
 Even though it doesnt require coding it makes much easier if you know at least basic logics about programming In addition you need to invest a lot of time to understand how bubble works but later you will get what you invest
 No the most intuitive on UI design and layout setting
 I havent used it much as I am the beginner but I like the supper super awesome
 getting started early on was one of the main challenges i would say
 At first it might sound a bit complicated although it is actually very easy so I recommend to have video explanations at the home page for new users
 Pouco conteúdo sobre como utilizar podemos melhorar a documentação assim como as ferramentas do front ent
 We shifted to build a web app with nextjs after the PoC phased end The issue is that it has difficulty to handle our json from server and render as expected
 It is a little difficult to design so I wish the builder is more intuitive
 There is no Desktop App availableIt would be nice when you could export your Webapp to Desktop
 It can be very hard to get used to If you want to become a power user id suggest buying an online course
 The ease of use was a little frustratingThe software didnt recognize my email at firstthen changed pages without me checking my email entrywhich was confusing 
 For Brazil the price for initial startups is very expensive I think they should bump up the Backups from  days to 30 days for the personal accounts
 A small startup so doesnt have a large support system of existing users yet
 I really liked itAt first I had problems with understanding itI suggest a more specific manual
 My friend made an app on it and it looks kind of ugly and slow So that might be a problem that the software brings for the user
 The UX is really good but I think continuing to add resources to tone down the technical terms and talk will continue to help their platform
