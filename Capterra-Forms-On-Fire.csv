Job Title,Industry,Used For,Overall,Pros,Cons,Date
Business Systems Consultant,"Computer Software, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,"Overall: I have built a fully comprehensive digital paperwork system with Forms on Fire for a client. It has transformed their business, automating many manual tasks and saving dozens of hours every month ongoing. The return on investment is off the charts. I also love the fact that the support is so responsive and helpful, even when it's a complex question I rarely need to explain more than once, and answers are timely and helpful, often going the extra mile.","Pros: The best thing about Forms on Fire is the flexibility. It's a blank canvas, you can create any type of form you require. With a little bit of technical knowledge it can be made extremely powerful. I appreciate the fact that it isn't aimed at consumers, as other form builder tools are, so it goes straight to the powerful functions needed in a business environment.","Cons: The built in data dashboards and analytics are adequate but not amazing. However these can be bypassed by exporting data to another platform using the integrations or API, and custom dashboards and reporting can be built there.","July 14, 2021"
 Associate Product Manager,"Internet, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,"Overall: Overall, Forms On Fire is a great tool for businesses or individuals looking for an efficient way to collect and manage data. The intuitive interface and comprehensive feature set make it an ideal choice for those looking to streamline their data collection process. The cost may be a barrier for some, but the powerful features justify the investment.","Pros: Forms On Fire is a powerful and intuitive data collection platform. It offers a wide range of features, including drag-and-drop form building, customizable workflows, and a comprehensive reporting system. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to set up and manage multiple forms quickly and efficiently. It also integrates with existing systems and allows for easy data sharing with third-party applications.","Cons: Although Forms On Fire offers a comprehensive set of features, it may be too complex for some users. The user interface can be a bit intimidating for those who are unfamiliar with web-based applications. Additionally, the cost of the premium version may be too steep for smaller businesses or individuals.","January 6, 2023"
Service Manager,"Hospital & Health Care, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,Pros: The application and backend are easy to use and normally very stable. FoF is great to work with to get issues ironed out or answer questions quickly if there is an issue or a question. ,Cons: It would be nice if the backend was more customizable. ,,"May 23, 2023"
Sales,"Construction, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,"Pros: The software is easy to use, clean interface, and alerts me when I am missing required information","Cons: There are frequent problems whenever we try to make an update, things don't seem to work how we expected them to. Also the documents this platform generates seem to be missing items and we can't figure out how to fix this.",,
Mfg Eng & QC Mgr,"Machinery, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,"Overall: Very pleased with the ease of developing our forms, distributing, updating, and collecting the uploaded data .The drag and drop interface for forms is outstanding and the help files make it easy to develop any workflow you can imagine, very powerful!","Pros: Our team especially liked the openness of the software programming interface, the associated help files, and the superb customer support whenever we had a question.We knew going in that we would have some""special tasks"" we would need to implement and Forms On Fire appeared to have the best programming system in place to easily make that happen using our own personnel and not requiring the software company to handle everything at additional cost.The system is so easy it just doesn't require that much support, but if you need it, they are there to help!","Cons: I think the website interface could use a few minor improvements like having data view columns maintain their positions between sessions or refreshes, and perhaps a little more development on the dashboard, although we'll probably develop our own that most of the vendors for this type of software simply don't offer.","May 28, 2019"
VP of Operations,"Real Estate, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,"Overall: I've been using FOF for over five years after assessing a number of ""industry"" solutions. They all sucked because they had to be built as a one-size-fits-all solution to apply to any of their customers. This is agile and fast. Everyone on the team loves it and it has generated a ton of cash for us, both in savings on labor/time/decision making, but also in billables that we weren't getting before through damages that lacked supporting documentation. We use this for everything. ","Pros: It allows us to see what's happening in the field (all of the fields) in real-time. It's completely customizable per site so I don't have to build some awful one-size-fits-no-one monstrosity. It's agile, can be changed on the fly, and is super easy to use. It's also affordable and adapts to fit whatever niche needs I may have in my organization. It's a true game-changer and one that's made my life 100x easier than it should for the cost and effort involved.","Cons: The learning curve at the start is decent. It took a few days of trial/error and exploring to unlock the full potential and abilities of what it can do. As it is fully customizable it's not an ""out of the box"" solution but that's truly a good thing. You make up for the initial learning effort by what you can eventually do with it. Spend the time, get to know it, and it will alter your operation in every way.","July 14, 2021"
Tech Services,"Wholesale, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,"Overall: Overall I'm very satisfied with the price we pay, and the ability to complete items in an app with an output report on our template. ","Pros: The output template is the most important feature to us. This way we can use our existing forms, and create a report we can immediately send to a customer while still onsite. ","Cons: Sometimes the customer support doesn't know what I am talking about when building the forms.Building the forms is sometimes very confusing, and very tedious. The amount of time it takes to build a form sometimes is not worth the effort over using excel. Not being able to force sync from the home page of the app is a downfall. ","July 28, 2021"
CTO,"Construction, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,"Pros: We were able to develop and deploy baseline functionality on our first project to help support what soon became a multifaceted, company-wide deployment of FOF across our enterprise. Ease of integration with tools like Salesforce and a responsive customer support team make this product a winner for anyone who needs to deploy a specialized field service app for construction, industrial, or environmental projects. ",Cons: The mobile design patterns are useful and utilitarian but they are somewhat limited and not customizable. This is the not the product to use if you want to highly customize the UI. This may be the case with most no/low code mobile app platforms as I do not have familiarity with many others.,"Alternatives Considered: BarCloud, GoCanvas and Salesforce Field Service","November 30, 2021"
General Manager,"Environmental Services, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,Overall: Switched form another mobile forms platform. Needed stable pricing for our business. Switch was seamless and made team more productive immediately. ,Pros: Implementation was intuitive and straightforward. Form building was easy to understand. Having a windows version made implementation and use more efficient.,Cons: In depth training opportunities would be helpful,"July 28, 2021"
Sales & Marketing,"Renewables & Environment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,"Overall: We needed a way to capture survey information from our engineers and have that data distributed to our designers and sales people to assess the results - many of our customers are in rural areas with no internet coverage, so the ability to work off-line was critical. We use the software on a regular basis and are able to instantly update the survey forms with engineer feedback for re-use within minutes.It has helped us conform to industry documentation requirements as well as provide consistent data for our designers to work with.",Pros: Easy to use and create sophisticated data entry forms for our engineers to capture customer data.The killer feature for us is the off-line ability to capture data and then upload automatically when next connected.Customer support is amazing!,"Cons: It does a whole lot more than we need, so it would be good to be able to use a simpler cut-down version","July 14, 2021"
Technical Project Delivery Lead,"Renewables & Environment, 5001-10,000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,"Pros: In one word: flexibility. Basic forms can be developed by almost anybody. More advanced forms can be developed by getting a little creative, though you may need to reach out to Forms on Fire to help implement your desired solution.","Cons: Forms on Fire can be incredibly complex, requiring users to do a lot of learning.",Switched From: Laserfiche,
Marketing Coordinator,"Leisure, Travel & Tourism, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,Overall: The mobile experience is great overall. We got problems with specific form when we tried to get a task done.The mobile version is pretty much intuitive. Users learned very quickly by themselves.,Pros: This software has multiple features.The form builder offers you any kind of options you'd have and needs.Their customer service and technician quickly reply to your questions and problems.Detailed users management.,"Cons: The form builder is a bit tricky to learn. If your needs are basics features it's quite simple, but since you get in more complex forms then you'd probably need their help to get it work properly.","April 18, 2020"
Territory Manager,"Architecture & Planning, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,"Overall: Mobile option helped us stay informed with weekly, monthly and yearly sales at all of our assigned store locations.","Pros: Ease of use with platform. I visit stores daily and use this tool to keep track of previous visits, sales data has been incorporated into the tool, as well as relevant information to help keep stores and my on track. This software was modified to fit what the Territory Managers with my company needed and required of the tool.","Cons: Excellent initial product, but needed modified to fit my job.","April 18, 2020"
Product Manager,"Medical Devices, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,Overall: Collecting an extensive amount of information and submitting it to the CRM via REST Requests. ,Pros: The level of flexibility you get in FoF is insane. You can basically create any form that will be tailored to your business needs. A variety of integration options supports this statement.,Cons: More design customizations and remote user management would make a great addition to the features set of FoF.,"May 9, 2022"
VP,"Hospital & Health Care, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,Overall: Ease of doing forms online in the field,Pros: Once you learn the program it is easy to use. The setup is easy to use with tablets in the field.,Cons: There is a learning curve on creating the forms.When there is an error in your form it is not always easy to trace back.I also think that the program is the most glitchy when I am creating a large form.,"April 11, 2018"
Executive Chairman,"Renewables & Environment, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,Overall: It's been extremely positive. From implementation to support the people there have been wonderful.,Pros: The sheer amount of API and Cap integrations make this software so versatile in managing and collecting data. All you need to do is set it up on the back-end and users will intuitively understand how to make it work.,"Cons: Nothing yet, so far this has been exactly as I had hoped it would be.","April 23, 2021"
Property manager,"Real Estate, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,Overall: My overall experience has been great. I've been using Forms On Fire for almost 3 years and have no complaints!,Pros: I love how easy the app is and the different apps we have been able to build within forms on fire. It makes our day-to-day easier.,Cons: At this time I cannot think of any features that need improvement.,"August 10, 2022"
Analyst,"Retail, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,Overall: [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] at Forms on Fire helped us to build a mobile app to support all of our merchandising representatives visiting retail stores across the country.They have up-to-date store data at their fingertips as well as all the notes they took the last time they visited.,Pros: The platform provides the standard infrastructure along with incredible flexibility to build the app that your business needs.,Cons: I only wish I was able to spend the time learn how to do more of the programming myself. ,"April 21, 2020"
Sales Director,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,Overall: We chose to move to electronic forms because our tech lost the occasional work order and this incurs costs for our company and we wanted to eliminate losses from that department. With forms on fire there is no reason to ever lose a form again.,"Pros: Price: We're a small business so we didn't want to spend huge amounts of money on this solution and the folks at forms on fire have been able to give us everything we wanted at a very fair price. Work performed: The work they put in our forms was astounding and the effort to meet our deadlines was impressive ( we met the deadline btw). The end result is a very intuitive form that we're proud of showing off to our customers and that our employees love. ","Cons: As far as I'm concerned there are no cons, you could argue that the software has a bit of a learning curve but I would argue back that any powerful ( feature packed) software has a steep learning curve.","August 24, 2017"
Branch Manager,"Public Safety, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,Overall: Extremely pleased.Easy to use and to instruct new hires ,Pros: Very easy to navigate.Format is easy to navigate,Cons: I have no issues with this program.It offers everything we need.,"May 3, 2020"
Office Manager,"Restaurants, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,Pros: I like the ease with which my field reps can do their inspection reports.And its fairly easy to program the pages once I learned how.I've also been able to upload some reference materials that field reps can view and share with store owners and that is very convenient.,Cons: Data Entries Table View is cumbersome.I'd like to be able to sort the columns by relevance so I can see at a glancethe info I need.Or it would be helpful if I could freeze pane so I can keep the left column stable while scrolling through the next 20 columns.,,"April 10, 2018"
Senior Data Engineer,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,Overall: We are using Forms on Fire to digitise engineering inspection processes in the rail industry.,Pros: - Lots of options for form field types- Lots of flexibility with integrations to other systems and external data connections (G drive etc)- Great usage of offline data storage and gps tracking- Designed in such a way that lots of simple building blocks can be used to create quite sophisticated data entry applications.- Support is great and ver,Cons: - Support is mostly centred around US timezones (we are Australian),
Director,Unspecified,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,Pros: Seems simple to use once it is setup.Customer service is pleasant but the email help is obtuse. Simple terminology would be more helpful.,Cons: Difficult to get started. The help emails are designed for computer geeks. They assume that lay people understand the terms used.,,
Project Controller,"Logistics and Supply Chain, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,Overall: This is a good App and hope it gets better.,Pros: Its easy to use both on mobile and computer.,Cons: You have to force sync to have it working sometimes.,"March 4, 2021"
Accounting Manager,"Real Estate, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,Overall: Lifesaver for what we need. ,Pros: I like the pdf that is automatically generated when a user completes a form. It adds a timestamp and geographical location and can easily be emailed to our clients. ,"Cons: When there are technical difficulties, it's really hard to get in touch with support. ","April 20, 2020"
Operations Manager,"Construction, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,Overall: Helps us stand out from the competition,Pros: Connectivity with other software. It allows us to include pictures into the report.,"Cons: Programming is not that easy, hard to learn.",
Director of Marketing,Unspecified,Used the software for: 6-12 months,Overall: Ability to gather info from guys in the field and turn it into nice-looking reports for customers and actionable knowledge for the office.,"Pros: When my business needed a form built and I was tired of waiting for programmers to build stuff for us that cost a lot of money and our time trying to explain to them what we needed, then wasn't quite right because they still don't really understand our business, I decided to build one myself. I then spent a lot of time looking at different products, and most of the ones that had the core functionality I needed (the ability to automatically create PDFs) were either too annoyingly simple and couldn't make the calculations I needed or they were so complex I would have to learn a lot of programming. Thank goodness I found Forms on Fire! It's the perfect middle ground that lets me do amazing things with a little work and playing around but takes care of the basics in the background.","Cons: They have a knowledge base that is great for getting started, but often doesn't show enough examples for me to quickly understand how to make their more advanced features work. And sometimes they go ahead and release new features (yay!) without fully debugging or writing up how to use or the bugs they've already found and are working on.","May 25, 2018"
Project Manager,"Automotive, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,Overall: Forms on fire was exactly the middle ground we needed between being offline using paper and developping our own mobile app for internal use. We decided that simply digitizing the forms was the best use of our time and money and it has had a great ROI. Within the first 3 weeks of using FoF we were able to increase productivity and decrease paper to computer entry completely. Reports that usually took 1 hrs to gather the information and another hour to digitize and publish could be done on the fly during the data gathering phase.,"Pros: This software is so easy to use! If you can drag and drop you can make a nice UI and form that is accessible reliably from any mobile platform. We really did have an easy time taking our existing excel sheets, modifying them to a forms on fire friendly format and setting that up. Total effort was about 10 hrs for a form conversion (first time, and done manually).","Cons: We got stuck with a few elements (how to pass data in a certain format) that didn't work, but Forms on fire customer support were available to help us get through it. It turns out it was user error and not Forms on Fire ","April 22, 2022"
Managing Partner,"Real Estate, Unspecified",Used the software for: 2+ years,"Overall: FoF allowed us to create custom inspection forms to match exactly what we needed without any superfluous junk that would just get in the way. Other platforms we looked at required us to use pre-existing templates that would make us either have to ignore or fill out stuff we didn't care about, while FoF allowed us to make custom inspection forms for every aspect of the business for easy tracking/sorting/recording of in-field data that's vital to our business. ","Pros: It allows anyone to customize inspection forms for literally any industry and/or location at an affordable price. Get just what you want, nothing more, nothing less. One-size-fits-all doesn't actually fit anyone; this software fits YOU like a bespoke suit from Lloyd's of London. ","Cons: The interface to make your own forms isn't 100% intuitive, though the amount of time needed to learn is very short and you can be up and running in less than an hour. Subsequent customization of forms is really easy.","April 13, 2018"
CEO,Unspecified,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,"Pros: I'm a CODiE Award judge and have seen a ton of product. Forms On Fire are clearly mobile experts and have built a product that solves a core problem: how to create forms that make everyone's life easier - starting with yours!(No need to hire an army of SW developers who'll take months, only to add so much complexity that end-users won't use them.)In my opinion, here are some best use cases:Marketing & Finance Execs have 100's of new projects requiring input from multiple key stakeholders, critical dependencies and conflicting deadlines (activations, email campaigns, events, trade shows, surveys, new product launches, press releases, content updates etc..). Collaboration meetings are endless, the teams out straight and deadlines are near.The last thing anyone wants to do is fill out a form - unless you can make one that's easy and adds to their productivity, rather than subtracts.Formsonfire let's you create a form for repeatable tasks that you can also pre-set to be sent to the parties you choose to, at the schedule you need. Its intuitive design, the fanatically customer-centric support team and library of visual tutorials, ensure the form you envisioned is exactly what you get. Only you know how your key stakeholders' world works. You can make it easy for them, and they'll make life easier for you.In today's gig economy, (Lyft, Uber, Instacart, Postmates, Jobble etc.),HR onboards 100's or staff, quickly and accurately. Formsonfire's the answer!",Cons: I was able to get started without contacting them for any help. But more tutorials are always welcome.,,
Certified Inspector,Unspecified,Used the software for: Unspecified,"Overall: I run a small business and needed a form built. I had looked at other places but most required you to pay them to build a form and were easily over $2,000. A reason I was attracted to Forms on Fire was they provide DIY templates which can be customized. Before trying to build it myself, I enquired about them building my form. Their estimate came back at the price for an 8 hour retainer(Quite Hefty).At hearing that, I Reckon as long as it doesn't take me 80 hours to build it on my own ill be doing ok. I am not a computer savvy person, I didn't know what many of the names of certain features meant. At the time I thought maybe for a person who's used to building forms with binary code or something crazy this may be an ""easy"" DIY form builder. For a person off the street however, I think it would be very confusing. If it were not for Learning about a free tech support session with one of their staff,I think I would still be banging my head on my desk. Ijumped at the chance to get some insight into this brave new world I had entered. I was astoundingly fortunate to have spent the session with Megan who was absolutely delighted to show me through the form and explain the terminology(FYI they have since put together a bunch of youtube video tutorials).After that amazingly helpful session, I then proceeded to build my entire form for the next three hours( it really is easy once you know what the terminology is). The form has since taken maybe another hour to tweak and add some things to make it perfect. All told from beginning to end it has taken five hours(75 hours ahead of schedule...SAVINGS!). Once I was guided through, it actually became fun. I'm so happy with how it turned out, and it has given me a huge advantage over the competition. I would highly recommend watching the videos, taking the support session(I hope you get to spend the session with megan she is a wonderful guide) and build it yourself. The feeling of accomplishment and knowing its built to your exact specifications, saving money but more importantly time is priceless. cheers!!",,,
Principal Scientist/Project Manager,"Environmental Services, 10,001+ employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,"Overall: We are using Forms on Fire on all our field tablets to gather resident and sampling information. Greatly reduces the use of paper, and minimizes with pull down menus the typing errors, etc.","Pros:  System is flexible, powerful, and easily adaptable to a lot of different applications. We were able to use existing templates and got them integrated into our user platform relatively easy. User friendly, app does save any information entered if you have to quickly exit and loose service.Fantastic customer support.","Cons: Some features are still being worked on, at times can become unstable and crash on us in the field. Fortunately, the entered data is being saved and we loose little time until we are back up and running.","May 15, 2020"
Consultant,Unspecified,Used the software for: Unspecified,"Overall: As a consultant serving a rapidly growing business, I needed a technology I could count on for reliability, scalability, easy configuration, and ease of maintenance. We didn't have the budget for a custom-code software project or to buy a big ERP solution. We had some internal processes and some customer-facing processes that needed to be standardized, controlled, and mobilized to improve our performance against the bottom line and to strengthen our competitive edge. After a great deal of searching, I found Forms On Fire. The incredible flexibility and power of the Forms On Fire platform gave us everything we needed at an incredibly competitive price. One of the greatest things about it is the ease with which we can make changes to and manage the solution ourselves. That was an essential requirement that we had a hard time finding elsewhere.We needed something that could operate smoothly on our mobile devices. Some of our team are using tablets, some on smartphones, and all on a mixture of Android and iOS operating systems. We needed a solution to connect reliably to two external data systems, output PDF documents , and automatically send multiple emails throughout workflow processes. In the past, such a list of requirements would have been extremely expensive to produce and would have required contracting with software developers. When I found Forms On Fire I was elated because I knew I could take care of my client successfully and that many future projects would be a breeze.My clients often see technology implementations as expensive, time-consuming and risky. Forms On Fire really came through and showed us how painless it can be. Their customer service is outstanding and it helps to have competent, responsive help only a phone call away when you're dealing with the information backbone of a business. If you have been searching for something to enable and mobilize your business, Forms On Fire is the best answer I have found. I look forward to further work with them. ",,,
Project Information Manager,"Public Safety, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,"Overall: Has been excellent. For those familiar with Microsoft Excel the learning curve is gentle and the more one works in the system the more opportunities arise. The support from the Forms on Fire team has been fantastic, better than any other digital platform I've used even outside this space.",Pros: The fact that the platform is a blank slate that allows for a large amount of customization is very important for our organization as it means our digital information management can match the changing circumstances of the work site. The fact as well that it is a no code platform allows for area experts in our field to engage in the development of forms without the need for an extensive IT background.,"Cons: While luckily not the largest issue for us, the fact that there is a limit of 50,000 row in the data sources does mean that there can be a risk regarding large scale operations but there do seem to be some work around that we are exploring for our larger systems.","June 6, 2022"
CEO,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,Pros: Loved the easy way to setup our workflow and the form we needed and the easy way of finding our data,Cons: I really don´t have many cons for the type of tool that forms on fire presents itstelf. it does what it says,Alternatives Considered: Google Forms,"April 22, 2022"

Product Development,"Logistics and Supply Chain, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,"Overall: We started out using FOF as a basic inspection tool but we've started to realize how powerful it is for tasks such as inventory management. Equally impressive is the ability to generate, email and file really nice templated documents in under a minute. ",Pros: We've used this software for everything from general inspections to land assessments. Except for a few advanced features the software is exceptionally easy to use and I've always received great customer service if I get stuck on something. Offline data capture and offline printing are really powerful features. ,Cons: Not much to dislike. It's a bit tough to get your head around some of the data-source read/write functions....but again their customer-service makes up for it whenever you encounter an issue. ,"June 4, 2019"
Senior Operations Manager,"Logistics and Supply Chain, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,Overall: Overall experience with this product has been great,Pros: Easy for end users to complete and share information,Cons: Data not always the way you want for presentation,"April 20, 2020"

,"Management Consulting, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,Overall: Ease of use as a designer and user.All of my users are very pleased with user experience. Great support team. ,"Pros: I have used forms on fire for several types of data collection with my team and have had a very positive experience as a form designer and user.The form builder is intuitive and easy to use and very easy to test.I love the fact that they have a windows app, especially when it comes to testing changes on my forms. Make a change, open window app, test and adjust. Anytime I hit a wall and I am not sure what to do, a few minutes spent on the support chat gets me what I need.Forms on fire is flexible, powerful and an economical way to collect the data my team needs from the field. ","Cons: Forms on Fire has a very extensive knowledge base, that could be improved by the addition of some short videos that walk users through some of the more complicated tasks.The support information is all there, I just learn easier when I can see it in action. ","January 26, 2018"
General Manager,"Real Estate, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,Overall: I found Forms on Fire about a year ago and it's had an unbelievable effect on our operations. I manage a large apartment community and collecting tons of in-field data is essential to what we do. FOF allowed us to create easy-to-use custom forms which streamlined our process and replaced paper entirely. We increased our billings for damage chargebacks by $30k this year due to the ease with which our Maintenance Techs could record the damages and select from pre-populated options - then the form emails a customer-ready PDF right to our Accounting Manager. It's brilliant. You absolutely can't find a better solution than FOF for all of your survey/data collection needs. I'm a raving fan.,"Pros: Ease of use is phenomenal. The customization is really the powerful feature here - you can get exactly what you want, and nothing you don't. It's truly a game changer.
